            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:262:5"/> you to countenance that in a Treatiſe, which you have ſo long countenanced in the practiſe. None ſo fit to bee a Patron of a Treatiſe of good Conſcience, as he that hath bin a religious both profeſſor, &amp; protector of the practiſe therof. To haue a <hi>Naile faſtned in a ſure place, the antiquity</hi>

                        <hi>Paul</hi> was here brought forth to anſwer for himſelfe before the chiefe Prieſts and the Councell: And his Preface, as I ſaid, to his intended Apology, if hee had not been injuriouſly interrupted, is a <hi>Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the goodnes of his conſcience, and this his good Conſcience, or the goodnes of his Conſcience he ſets forth;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From his <hi>Converſation</hi>

                        </gap>, I have lived or converſed. A good conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is a good evidence of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:262:10"/> indeed, there can be no good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, where there is not a Converſing in good. It is not ſome moods and fits in ſome good actions &amp; duties, from whence conſcience gaines the reputation of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but a good converſation, godly and religious in the generall tenour thereof, proves the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience worthy ſuch an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, as to be holden good. He may be ſaid to <hi>have a</hi> good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience that can be ſaid to <hi>live</hi> in a good conſcience. Many a man is frequent in the <hi>City,</hi> &amp; yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſaid to live there. There a man lives where he hath his Converſe &amp; Reſidence. A mans life is not to be meaſured by ſome few actions, in which at ſometime he may be found, but by his general courſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. God will judge every man not according to his <hi>ſteps,</hi> but according to his <hi>wayes.</hi> It were over-rigid cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to condemn a righteous man, and to queſtion whether his Conſcience were good, becauſe ſome ſteps of his have bin beſide the way. We know for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, his way is good wherein he walkes, and therefore according to his good way we judge his Conſcience good. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily when we ſee a mans way for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to be evill, though ſometime hee
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:262:10"/> may tread a right ſtep or two, and chance to chop into the faire road for a rod or two, for this to judge a mans Conſcience good, were a bottomleſſe and a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Charitie: Every mans Conſcience is as his life is.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Generalitie</hi> of his care and obedience, <hi>In all good Conſcience.</hi> It muſt be <hi>All good,</hi> or it is <hi>no good</hi> Conſcience at all. There be that live in <hi>ſome</hi> good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; yea <hi>Herod</hi> ſeemes to have <hi>much</hi> good Conſcience, hee did many things gladly, but yet <hi>Paul</hi> goes further, and lives not in <hi>ſome,</hi> not in <hi>much,</hi> but in <hi>All</hi> good Conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From the <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Integrity of it before God.</hi> Before men how many have their conſciences exceeding good, &amp; yet their conſciences are farre ſhort of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, becauſe they are not good <hi>before God,</hi> the judge of Conſcience. Whilſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is made onely of the Capitals of the ſecond Table, or of the externals and ceremonials of the firſt, which duty is not done out of obedience to God and his Commandements; but a mans ſelf either in his gaine, or in his praiſe is ſought, and baſe ends are the firſt movers to good duties, here the Conſcience, what ever
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:262:11"/> applauſe it hath from, or before men for it goodneſſe; yet, of God ſhall not be ſo eſteemed. For that is not a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience which is one outwardly, but which is one inwardly, whoſe praiſe is not of men but of God. And that hath its praiſe of God which is before God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. From his <hi>continuance and conſtancie untill this day.</hi> To begin a good life and courſe, and to live in all good conſcience, &amp; that before God, are excellent things; but yet one thing is wanting to make up this goodneſſe compleat. To be ſo for a day, or ſome dayes will not ſerve, but when a man can ſay at his laſt day, I have lived in all good Conſcience <hi>untill this day,</hi> that man may be ſafely judged to have a good Conſcience indeed. Thus in theſe foure particulars doth the goodnes of <hi>Pauls</hi> Conſcience appeare. It is not my purpoſe to confine my ſelfe, and to keep mee within thoſe bounds alone: but to take a larger latitude, within the compaſſe whereof I will bring both thoſe forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and all other materiall points which this <hi>Proteſtation</hi> doth afford.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>What Conſcience is:</hi> It may be thus deſcribed: Conſcience <hi>is a power and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the ſoule taking knowledge, and bearing witneſſe of all a mans thoughts, words and actions, and accordingly excuſing or accuſing, abſolving or condemning, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting or tormenting the ſame.</hi> I know there be other definitions given by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more ſuccinct, and neat, but I rather chuſe this, though it may be not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo formall to the rules of Art. The rules of love and profit many times may
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:262:12"/> make bold to diſpence with rules of Art. So I may be profitable, I care the leſſe to be artificiall. It may ſuffice that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is anſwerable to that Auditory for whoſe ſake it was firſt intended. A plaine familiar deſcription agrees well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with ſuch a people. For the better conceiving of it, let it be taken in pieces, and every parcell viewed ſeverally.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is a faculty or power of the ſoule.</hi> It is therefore called the <hi>Heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>If our heart condemne us, Eccl.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Thine own heart knows that thou thy ſelfe likewiſe haſt curſed others,</hi> that is, thine own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience knowes. It is alſo called the <hi>ſpirit of man,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>For what man knowes the things of a man, ſave the</hi> ſpirit of man <hi>which is in him.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. <hi>The ſpirit it ſelfe beares witneſſe with our ſpirit,</hi> that is, with our Conſcience. Not that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a ſpirit diſtinct from the ſubject of the ſoule, as <hi>Origen</hi> miſtooke, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a faculty of the ſoule, therefore the name that is oft given to the ſoule, is given to it. If it be asked in what part of the ſoule this facultie is placed, we muſt know that Conſcience is not confined to any one part of the ſoule: It is not in the underſtanding alone, not in the memory,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:262:12"/> will, or affections alone, but it hath place in all the parts of the ſoule, and according to the ſeverall parts thereof hath ſeverall Offices or acts.</p>

Conſcience is Gods Notary, and there is nothing paſſes us in our whole life good or ill, which Conſcience notes

Secondly a knowledge ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with another knowledge; for there is a double act of the vnderſtanding, Firſt, that wherby wee thinke or know a thing. Secondly, there is a reflecting act of the ſoule wherby we thinke what we thinke, and know what we know, and this is the action of the Conſcience; and this ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d knowledge to the firſt, giues it the name of Conſcience: As here in this place, As for our iniquities wee know them, that is, we know that wee have had evill thoughts, and our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge tels vs, &amp; witneſſes to vs, that we have done ſo. This agrees with <hi>Bernards</hi>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:262:14"/> definition, that <hi>Conſcientia eſt cordis ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi> Conſcience is the knowledge of the heart, namely paſſively. It is the knowing of what the heart knowes: which others in better termes have expreſſed thus, Conſcience is the recoiling of the ſoule vpon it ſelf; Sutable to that of the Apoſtle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>I know nothing by my ſelfe.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I know not any thing that I know againſt my ſelfe, my Conſcience doth not witneſſe againſt mee. And this ſecond office of Conſcience in bearing witneſſe is alſo in the memory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And accordingly accuſing or excuſing, abſolving or condemning]</hi> Theſe acts of Conſcience we finde <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Their thoughts accuſing or excuſing one another. Rom.</hi> 12. 22. Happy is he that <hi>condemneth</hi> not himſelf in that he allows. The ground of theſe acts is this; Conſcience, before actions are to be done, determines of their lawfulneſſe, and unlawfulneſſe; iudges of them whether they be good or evill. And if it iudge them good, it inuites, ſtirres vp, vrges, and bindes to the doing of them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5. Ye muſt be ſubiect <hi>for conſcience ſake;</hi> that is, becauſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience determines it to be good, &amp; vrges &amp; bindes thereunto. Hence that phraſe in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:262:15"/> common ſpeech, my conſcience vrgeth me to it, or he was vrged in conſcience to do it, and I am bound inconſcience to doe it. Certainly if it judge &amp; determine acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be evill &amp; unlawfull, then it binds from them. So much that ſpeech implies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 27. Eate, asking no queſtion <hi>for conſcience ſake.</hi> So that conſcience hath a power to bind to, and to bind from.</p>
                     <p>Now then when a man in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar actions doth follow the Preſcriptions, Dictates, Injunctions, Prohibitions, and Determinations of Conſcience, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens to the incitements therof, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience <hi>excuſes</hi> him, acquits and <hi>abſolves</hi> him. But if in his actions he go againſt any of theſe, then Conſcience <hi>accuſes</hi> him of offence, &amp; <hi>condemns</hi> him for that offence. The <hi>accuſation</hi> of conſcience hath reſpect unto a mans <hi>guilt,</hi> the <hi>condemnation</hi> of it unto a mans <hi>puniſhment. Accuſation</hi> is an act of Conſcience paſſing ſentence upon a mans action, as when conſcience tels him, This was ill done, this action was ſinfull. <hi>Condemnation</hi> is an act of conſcience, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſentence not onely upon a mans acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but upon a mans perſon, as when it tels him, Thou deſerveſt Gods wrath for this Sin. Conſcience in accuſing ſhewes what
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:262:15"/> is the <hi>quality;</hi> in condemning what is the <hi>deſert</hi> of a mans actions. And theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of conſcience are in the mind, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding part of the ſoule. The act of the conſcience in the memory determins <hi>de facto,</hi> and tels us what wee have done, or not done. The act of Conſcience in the underſtanding determines <hi>de jure,</hi> and tels us whether we have done well or ill, and ſo accordingly either excuſes or accuſes, acquits or condemns.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Comforting or tormenting the ſame]</hi> theſe be the laſt acts of conſcience follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the former. If Conſcience determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, preſcribing, and inciting to good, be hearkned unto, then it excuſes, acquits, &amp; thereupon followes comfort, joy, hope, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2.

And theſe actions of the conſcience are in the will, and in the affections. And thus according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts of the ſoule, the acts and office of conſcience are divers. In the memory it hath the office of a Notary, Regiſter, &amp;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:262:16"/> Witneſſe. In the underſtanding it hath the office of a Iudge, and an accuſer, of a <hi>Felix</hi> and a <hi>Tertullus.</hi> In the affections either of a Comforter, or Tormenter.</p>
                     <p>The ſumme of all may be thus knit up. Conſcience containes three things:
<list>
                           <item>1. Knowledge practicall.</item>
                           <item>2. Application of that knowledge to our particular eſtates, and actions.</item>

                        <hi>Vprightneſſe,</hi> and Peace; theſe two are required to the conſtitution of a good Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it is good with the goodneſſe of <hi>Integrity,</hi> when it is an upright co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience. This is that which <hi>Paul</hi> cals <hi>A pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. which Phraſe a man would almoſt think in his conſcience that the Holy Ghoſt uſed on ſet purpoſe, to ſtop the mouth of the iniquity of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, that ſhould ſeeke to diſgrace all good Conſcience with the ſarcaſme of purity. Now the conſcience is good with the goodneſſe of Integritie and Puritie three wayes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When it being informed and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly principled by the word of God, the only rule and binder of Conſcience, it doth truly and ſincerely judge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine evill to be evill, and good to be good. As contrarily, the conſcience is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully evill, when it doth not determine that to be evill which is evill, nor that to be good which is good, but call evill good, and good evill. Such as are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:262:17"/> of Ignorant perſons, who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the knowledge of Gods Word, and having their conſciences blinded through ignorance, are not able to judge of good or evill, nor to diſcerne and determine which is which. So that knowledge is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required to the goodnes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 14. <hi>Yee alſo are full of goodnes, filled with all knowledge.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot be good where the ſoule is naught, and <hi>that the ſoule be without knowledge, it is not good,</hi> Prov. 9. 2.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When it doth excuſe for that which is good, and accuſe for that which is evill, being ſanctified by the ſpirit of grace: for the accuſation of conſcience, though it follow upon ſin, yet it is not ſinfull and evill in it ſelfe, but only painfull and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, and ſo oppoſed to the goodnes of peace, not to the goodneſſe of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, according to that trite diſtinction of <hi>Bernard</hi> of a good Conſcience, and not quiet, &amp; a quiet conſcience, &amp; not good. It is the property of a conſcience upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good to accuſe upon any ſin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. As contrarily the conſcience is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully evill, when it doth not excuſe for good, nor accuſe for evill. The ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious perſon, omitting his fopperies,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:262:18"/> ſhould be excuſed by his Conſcience, wheras he rather receives blame from his Conſcience, therefore his Conſcience is ſinfully evill. The ſecure perſons conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is naught, becauſe he having co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſin, his Conſcience is ſilent, and lets him alone, and brings in no accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, therefore it is ſinfully evill. It is a <hi>witneſſe</hi> that hath <hi>ſeene,</hi> and <hi>knowne</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and doth not <hi>utter it,</hi> therfore it <hi>ſhall beare its iniquity,</hi> Levit. 5. 1.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When it doth incite and urge us to doe good, and doth ſtay and hinder from evill. It is uprightly good when it ſpurs to good, and bridles from evill, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18. <hi>For we are aſſured that we have a good Conſcience:</hi> viz. A conſcience that is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſilent to perſwade to that which is good, or diſſwade from that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. If a man go about or be ready to yield to any thing that is ſinful, how wil it mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter up legions of Arguments? how will it wraſtle and ſtruggle with a man? It will ſay as <hi>Abner</hi> to <hi>Ioab,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 26. <hi>knowſt thou not that it wil be bitternes in the later end?</hi> or as <hi>Abigail</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 31. <hi>It ſhall be no griefe, nor offence of heart unto thee</hi> another time, not to have done this evill. If a man be negligent, or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:262:18"/> careleſſe and drowſie in good duties, it comes to him with that voice, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt;</hi> or with that, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 21. <hi>This is the way, walke in it.</hi> When it doth thus, it is uprightly good. Contrarily, it is ſinfully evill, when it doth not incite us to that which is good, nor hinder us from doing evill. This is a dead, and a ſeared conſcience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Having their conſciences ſeared with an hot yron.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is good with the goodneſſe of <hi>Tranquility.</hi> And that is when the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is at peace, and doth not accuſe us, becauſe it hath not wherewith to accuſe us, either becauſe not guilty of ſuch or ſuch a particular fact, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>I know nothing by my ſelfe;</hi> or elſe becauſe it is aſſured of pardon in the bloud of Chriſt, by which we come to have no <hi>more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Sins,</hi> Heb. 10. 2. That is, no more Conſcience to accuſe or condemne for Sin, it being done away in the blood of Chriſt: and this is the <hi>purged Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. which brings Hope, Ioy, Comfort, and confidence with it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>This is our rejoycing, the teſtimony of our Conſcience.</hi> Then is the Conſcience good, when it is peaceable. As contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:262:19"/> then it is evill, painfully evill, when it is turbulent, and troubleſome in the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations thereof, and binds over to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo leaves us in ſhame, feare, perplexity, and griefe, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>If our heart condemne us.</hi> This is a wounded, a troubled conſcience. This is oft the evill conſcience of evill men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 21. <hi>There is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God.</hi> Yet may a man have his Conſcience upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, which is painfully evill; for a good mans Conſcience may be unquiet and troubled. Thus then wee ſee what a good conſcience is, that which is upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honeſt, and quietly peaceable. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, it ſerves to diſcover the dangerous errour of divers ſorts of people, that are in a dreame of having good conſciences, and yet having nothing leſſe. There be three ſorts of conſciences, which becauſe they are in ſome ſort quiet, and ſting not, their owners would have to goe for good ones, and yet are ſtarke naught, and they are, the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> the <hi>Secure,</hi> and the <hi>Seared</hi> Conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Ignorant</hi> Conſcience, Men judge of their ignorant conſciences, as they do of their blind, dumbe, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:262:19"/> Miniſters: Such neither doe nor can Preach, can neither tell men of their ſins, nor of their duties. Aske ſuch a blinde guides people, what their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit is of him, &amp; what a kind of man their Miniſter is, &amp; ye ſhall have him magnified for a paſſing honeſt harmleſſe man, and a man won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous quiet amongſt his neighbors. They may doe what they will for him, hee is none of thoſe troubleſome fellowes that will be reproving their faults, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of their diſorders in the Pulpit; oh, ſuch a one is a quiet good man indeed. Thus judge many of their Conſciences. If their Conſciences be quiet, and lie not grating upon them, and telling them that their courſes are ſinfull, &amp; damnable, and that their perſons are in a dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but rather by their ſilence, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and vaine pretences doe juſtifie them, and tell them all will be well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Oh then what excellent good Conſciences have theſe men! They make no Conſcience of Family duties, once in the yeare to come to the Sacrament ſerves the turne; they are common ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in their ordinary communication, make no conſcience of ſanctifying Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, &amp;c. and their conſciences let them
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:262:20"/> alone in all theſe, doe not give them one ſyllable of ill language, oh what gentle, &amp; good natured Conſciences think theſe men they have? But alas, what <hi>evill</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences have they? A good Conſcience muſt be <hi>upright</hi> as well as <hi>peaceable.</hi> And an upright Conſcience is enlightned with the knowledge of the Word, and by that light judges what is good, &amp; what evil, &amp; when it finds mens actions not to be good and warrantable, deales plainly, and lets them heare of it. A good Conſcience hath good eyes, and is able to diſcerne betweene good and evill. Now theſe mens Conſciences are quiet, and have their mouths ſhut, but whence is it? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their eyes are ſhut, and they are dumbe, becauſe they are blind. Right I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll Conſciences, they want mouths to ſpeake, becauſe they want eyes to ſee. So that it may be ſaid of ſuch Conſciences as the Prophet ſpeaks of thoſe Watchmen, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 10. <hi>His watchmen are blind, they are all ignorant, they are all dumbe dogs, they cannot barke.</hi> Their blindneſſe bred dumbneſſe, and their ignorance ſilence. Thus it is with ignorant Conſcience. What is the reaſon they barke not, but are dumbe, and are thus quiet? Meerly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:262:20"/> becauſe they are blind and ignorant.</p>
                     <p>But yet as good as men account theſe conſciences now, the time will come that it ſhall fare with them as it did with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> after they had eaten the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit, <hi>Then their eyes were opened.</hi> So the time will come when theſe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſhall have their eyes opened, and then alſo ſhall their mouths be opened, yea wide, and loud opened, and theſe now quiet conſciences ſhall both bark and bite too. Doe not therefore flatter thy ſelfe in thine ignorance, as if thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Conſcience were good, becauſe quiet. Never account that true Peace which is not joyned with uprightneſſe. Integrity and ignorance can no more ſtand together than light and darkneſſe. Integrity of Conſcience may be without Peace. Peace can never be without Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. Dumbe Miniſters go in the world for good Miniſters, becauſe quiet ones, but the day will come that men ſhall curſe them for having been ſo quiet. So igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and tongue-tyed conſciences go for good ones, but the time will come that men will curſe this peace of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, for bringing them ſo quietly to hell. The Maſſe goes for an excellent
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:262:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> good Service, becauſe <hi>Miſſa non mordet,</hi> honeſt toothleſſe devotion, it never fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens fang in the hearers fleſh. So many have Maſſe-like Conſciences, toothleſſe, and tongueleſſe Conſciences, but yet the time will come, that as Maſſe-mongers ſhall curſe their toothleſſe Maſſe, ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant perſons that now glory in their peace, ſhall curſe their toothleſſe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yea they ſhall gnaſh their teeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Conſcience had no teeth, and ſhall gnaw their tongues for anguiſh of heart, becauſe their conſciences wanted tongues to tel them of the danger of their wicked wayes, that have brought them to ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable a condition.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Secure</hi> Conſcience. As the blind Conſcience was like the dumbe Miniſter, ſo the ſecure Conſcience is like the flattering Miniſter, that <hi>(Ier.</hi> 6. 13.) heales the hurt of his people with <hi>ſweet words, and cries, peace, peace, where there is no peace.</hi> This Conſcience wants not an eye, but only a good tongue in the head. It ſees its maſter to doe evill, and knowes it to be evil, but either cares not to ſpeak, or elſe is eaſily put off from ſpeaking; ſometime it cares not to ſpeake, being ſleepy, heavie, and drowſie, like thoſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:262:21"/> Prophets, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 10. <hi>They are all dumbe dogs, they cannot barke.</hi> What is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? <hi>Sleeping, lying downe, loving to ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> A ſleepy, and heavy-eyed Curre, though he ſee one come into his maſters yard, or houſe, that ſhould not, yet barkes not, as loath by his barking to diſquiet himſelfe. A ſleepy ſecure conſcience ſees many a Sin to enter the ſoule that ſhould not, and yet lies ſtill and ſayes nothing, is loath to breake his ſleepe. And yet ſuch Conſciences men count good.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes it may be it offers to ſpeak, as a ſleepy dog may open once, or twice at a ſtrangers entrance, yet is ſoone ſnibd, the leaſt word of the maſter of the houſe makes him whiſt, and quiet. So ſecure Conſciences upon the greene wound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſmart, and upon the freſh commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sin begin to mutter, and to have ſome grudgings, but their maſter anſwers them as the friend in his bed did his neighbor deſiring to borrow three loavs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 17. <hi>Trouble me not, for I am in bed.</hi> I pray thee be quiet, let us have no wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling and brawling, it ſhal be ſo no more, I will cry God mercy, I will hereafter find a time for repentance, &amp;c. and ſo Conſcience being ſecure is eaſily put off
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:262:22"/> with a few good words, and ſo cloſing her eyes and mouth againe, gives her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter liberty to take his reſt. And thus the ſecure Conſcience, becauſe it is ſo eaſily huſht, and ſtilled, is counted a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as Nurſes counted them good children which though they are ready to cry at every turne, yet are eaſily quieted with ſome toy.</p>
                     <p>But this Conſcience is as far from a good Conſcience, as Securitie is from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity. Sin indeed ſleeps, but yet it ſleeps but dogs ſleepe, yea though it ſleepe ſoundly, yet it cannot ſleepe long. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Sin lies at the doore.</hi> Sin lies aſleepe in the Conſcience as a Maſtife lies at the doore. A place where a dog cannot ſleep long. The doore is the common paſſage into and out of the houſe, every one is paſſing to and fro that way, and keep ſuch a clattering with the opening and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the doore, that there can be no ſound, or at leaſt, no long ſleepe. No bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the ſleepe of ſecure Conſciences, which at length like mad band-dogs and fell maſtifes, will fly in the face of the ſinner, ready to pluck out the very throat and heart of him.</p>
                     <p>The ſecure conſcience can be no good
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:262:22"/> Conſcience, becauſe it hath neither <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe</hi> nor <hi>peace,</hi> both which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore required to the temper of a good one, <hi>Vprightneſſe</hi> hath it none, for it is not faithfull in its office, it doth not witneſſe, it doth not accuſe, as it becomes an honeſt upright conſcience to doe. <hi>Peace</hi> it hath none. There is a great difference between a peace, and a truce: in peace there is a totall depoſition, both of Armes and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, all hoſtile affections are put off: In a truce, there is but a ſuſpention, and a ceſſation of Armes for a ſeaſon, ſo as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſame there is ſtill proviſion of more Force, and a preparation of greater ſtrength. A truce is but a breathing time to fit for fiercer impreſſions. The truce being ended, the aſſaults are rather fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer than they were before. The ſecure Conſciences are quiet, not becauſe there is peace, for <hi>there is no peace to the wicked,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Quomodo tranquilla? cum mundi hujus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitas allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, &amp; illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, cum lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derijs animae ſuae. <hi>Born. de Conſe.</hi>

But becauſe there is ſome truce, the world ſmiles upon them and they have outward hearts eaſe, and this brings them aſleepe, but if any affliction, croſſe, or ſickneſſe come, then they ſee how far they are from peace. Conſcience is ſometime at truce with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſinners, but during this truce, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:262:23"/> is preparing Armes, and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition againſt them, is levying of freſh forces againſt them, and aſſoone as the truce is ended, be it ſooner or be it later, have at them with more violence, fury, &amp; fiercenes than ever before. And the truce once ended, it will eaſilie appeare what a wide breadth of difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſecure and a good Conſcience.</p>

That which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>A cauterized Conſcience.</hi> That is, as <hi>Beza</hi> tranſlates and expounds it. A Conſcience cut off, as it were with a Chirugions Inſtrument. An arme, or a leg cut off from the body, ſtab it, gaſh it, chop it into gobbets, do what you will with it, it is inſenſible, it feeles it not. Or elſe as our tranſlation hath it, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Conſciences ſeared with an hot iron.</hi> A compariſon borrowed from Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie. When a limbe is cut off, Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugions uſe to ſeare that part of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from whence the other is taken, with an hot iron, and ſometimes they do cures by ſearing the affected parts with hot irons. Now theſe parts upon their ſearing have a kind of cruſty brawnineſſe, which is utterly inſenſible, which though it be cut, or pricked, it neither bleeds, nor
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:262:23"/> feeles. Thus is it with many mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, commit they whatſoever ſins they will, yet their hearts are ſo hardned through long cuſtome in ſin, that they feele no gripings, pinches, or bitings at all, but are growne to that dead, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent diſpoſition, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>Who being paſt feeling, &amp;c.</hi> It is with ſuch mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, as with labouring mens hands, which through much labor have a braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hardneſſe growing upon them which is without any feeling. One may thruſt pins into it, pare it with a knife, and yet without any trouble or griefe at all. Such callous Conſciences have many, that though they be wounded, and gaſhed with never ſuch foule ſins, yet their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſhrink not, feele not awhit. Their Conſciences are like Gally-ſlaves backs, ſo bebrawned over with often laſhing, that an ordinary laſh will not make them ſo much as once ſhuck in their ſhoulders. You have many that can ſweare, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your more civill oathes, of faith and troth, but thoſe ruffianly and bloudy oathes, of bloud and wounds, and it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wounds their hearts awhit. You have many that can commit foule ſins with leſſe touch than others can heare of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:262:24"/> them. You ſhall have black Smiths that are uſed to the frequent and daily hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of hot iron, hold an hot firecoale in their hands, and laugh, whilſt another would roare out. There be thoſe that can be drunke day after day, that conſecrate whole Sabbaths to <hi>Venus</hi> &amp; <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and give themſelvs up to foule villanies, &amp; yet not one twitch at the heart, not a ſnib, not a croſſe word from their Conſciences. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrich-like they can concoct iron and put it off as eaſily as another weake ſtomacke can doe gelly. They have brought their hearts to that paſſe the drunkards body is in, <hi>Pro.</hi> 25. 35. <hi>They have ſtriken me, and I was not ſick; they have eaten me, and I felt it not.</hi> Their ſeared Conſciences have no more feeling than our ſotted Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards have in their drunkenneſſe, who though they have many a knocke, and ſore bruiſe, yet feele it not. To this feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full condition, and ſenſeleſſe and ſeared ſtupiditie of Conſcience many growe, and when they have thus cruſted and brawned the ſame, then they have their Conſciences at a good paſſe, becavſe they heare them not brawling within them. Alas how farre are ſuch from goodneſſe of Conſcience? In ſome
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:262:24"/> ſenſe, thoſe have worſe Conſciences than the Devill himſelfe, who beleeves and trembles, whoſe Conſcience yet is not ſo ſeared, but it trembles at the thoughts of his deſerved damnation.</p>
                     <p>And howſoever theſe ſeared Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are quiet, yet there will come a day that this ſeared cruſtineſſe ſhall bee ſcaled off, and thoſe Conſciences which were not ſenſible of ſinne, ſhall be moſt ſenſible of paine: though they were paſt feeling in the committing of ſinne, yet they ſhall be all feeling in ſuffering pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſinne. God will pare off that brawnineſſe from their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and will pare them ſo to the quicke, that they ſhall feele, and moſt ſenſibly feele, that which here they would not feele. Tremble therefore at the having of ſuch a Conſcience, in which there is neither uprightneſſe, nor peace, neither integrity, nor tranquility; but a ſenſleſſe and fearfull ſtupidity. Thus we have ſeen what a good Conſcience is.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Peace of Conſcience how gotten.</head>
                     <p>IT followes now to know how a man may get and keepe a good one, which
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:262:25"/> is the third point which was propounded to be handled. A point well worth our inquiring after. A good Conſcience is the moſt precious thing that a Chriſtian can have: a thing of that eſteeme that where it is wanting, wee account a man without a Conſcience. So of a man that hath an ill Conſcience we uſe to ſay, he is a man of no conſcience. Not that he hath no Conſcience, the Devils themſelves have a conſcience, and happy it were for them they had none; but when a man hath not a good one, we eſteeme of him as having none at all. There is no greater good we can ſeeke after than a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Let us enquire then how we may get, and keepe this ſo great a good.</p>
                     <p>A good Conſcience then conſiſting in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> theſe two being got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and kept, wee ſhall get and keepe a good Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then to make the Conſcience peaceably good, theſe things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt, and his blood. The conſcience cannot be at peace till it be purged from its guilt. An impure conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but be an unquiet conſcience, and every guilty Conſcience is impure.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:262:25"/> Guilt is the ſame to the Conſcience that the winds are to the ſeas, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 20. 21. <hi>The wicked are like the troubled Sea when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up myre and dirt, there is no peace to the wicked.</hi> Now that which makes the ſea ſo troubleſome and ragingly reſtleſſe, is the violence of the bluſtering winds that trouble &amp; toſſe it to and fro. The winds are not ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to the ſea, as guilt is to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Therefore as the way to calme the Sea, is to calme the winds; ſo the way to quiet and calme the Conſcience, is to purge and take away the guilt. Guilt is in the Conſcience as <hi>Ionas</hi> in the Ship, out with him, and Sea and Ship are both quiet. But how then ſhall the guilt be purged out of the Conſcience? That we find, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>How much more ſhall the bloud of Chriſt purge our Conſciences from dead works?</hi> We cannot have a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience till we be freed from an evill one. The way to be freed from an evill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is to have <hi>our hearts ſprinkled from an evill Conſcience, Heb.</hi> 10. 22. But what is that wherewith the conſcience muſt be ſprinkled to be made good with peace and quietnes? the ſame which we find, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>The ſprinkling of the blood of Ieſus</hi>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:262:26"/> 
                        <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. <hi>The blood of ſprinkling which ſpeaks better things than that of Abel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So then the Conſcience ſprinkled with Chriſts bloud ceaſes to be evill, becomes good and peaceable. The ſame Chriſt that calmed the rage of the Sea by ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the winds, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4. 39. <hi>He aroſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked the wind, and ſaid unto the Sea, peace, and be ſtill, and the wind ceaſed, and there was a great calm;</hi> the ſame Chriſt it is that ſtils the rage of the conſcience, by taking and purging away the guilt thereof, with the ſprinkling on of his bloud. His bloud <hi>ſpeakes, Heb.</hi> 12. 24. And ſpeakes not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God, but ſpeakes to the conſcience. The voyce which it ſpeakes, is <hi>Peace and be ſtill,</hi> the ſame voyce which to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples after his reſurrection, <hi>Peace be with you;</hi> and then followes a great calme, and peace makes the Conſcience good.</p>
                     <p>But heare the Conſcience will inquire how it may come to get this bloud ſprinkled upon it, to make it thus peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly good, and what is it that applies this calming bloud of Chriſt? I anſwer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That it is the grace of faith, therfore it was ſaid before, that faith in Chriſts blood makes peace in the Conſcience. Faith is the hand of the ſoule, and as the hyſſope ſprinkle, by which Chriſts bloud
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:262:26"/> is ſprinkled upon our Conſciences, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Let us draw neere with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evill Conſcience.</hi> And <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing justified by faith we have peace towards God. Rom.</hi> 5. 1. Hence that conjunction of faith and a good Conſcience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>of a good Conſcience, and of faith unfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> and ver. 19. <hi>Holding faith and a good Conſcience.</hi> For faith it is that makes a good conſcience, by making a quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Faith is not only a purifying grace, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. but it is alſo a pacifying grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. It not onely purges our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, by applying the efficacie of Chriſts bloud, but ſpecially purges our guilt by applying the merit of his bloud. So that no faith, no peace; and no peace, no good Conſcience. A defiled Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can be no good Conſcience, and what defiles the Conſcience? See <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Vnto them that are defiled and unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, nothing is pure, but even their mind and Conſcience is defiled.</hi> They that be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed have their conſciences defiled, but how come they and their Conſciences ſo? <hi>To them that are defiled and unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi> Therefore an unbelieving Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a defiled conſcience, and a defiled
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:262:27"/> conſcience is no good conſcience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it can have no peace ſo long as it is clogged with defiling guilt. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, faith purifying not onely from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but from guilt, by the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts bloud makes the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence pure and peaceable both.</p>
                     <p>There can be no <hi>peace</hi> of conſcience but where there is the righteouſneſſe of the perſon. There is no peace to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 21. as if he ſhould ſay, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill unrighteous perſon cannot have a good conſcience: where the perſon is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, there the conſcience cannot be good. Now faith in Chriſts bloud makes a mans perſon good, &amp; ſo the conſcience becomes good. It makes the perſon <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> and the perſon being <hi>righteous,</hi> the conſcience is at <hi>peace;</hi> for <hi>the worke</hi> of righteouſneſſe, is peace, <hi>and the effect</hi> of righteouſneſſe, quietneſſe, <hi>and aſſurance for ever, Iſa.</hi> 32. 17. with which that of the Apoſtle ſweetly ſutes, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>Firſt King of</hi> righteouſneſſe, <hi>and after that King of</hi> peace. Our perſons muſt firſt find Chriſt a King of <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> by juſtifying them from their guilt, before our conſciences can find him King of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> pacifying them from their unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Our perſons once <hi>justified</hi> by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:262:27"/> Chriſts blood from their guilt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, our conſciences are <hi>paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> and freed from their unquietneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Wouldſt thou then have a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? Get the peace of conſcience. Wouldſt thou have Peace in thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Get faith in thy ſoule; Believe in the Lord Ieſus, and get thy ſoule ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with his bloud, and then <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 2. Thou ſhalt have no more conſcience of Sin, thy Conſcience ſhall be at quiet, no more accuſing thee, nor threatning thee condemnation for thy Sin.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Repentance</hi> from dead workes. Though Chriſts bloud be that which purges the conſcience from dead works, and ſo workes peace; yet that peace is not wrought in our apprehenſion; neither do we get the feeling of this faith without ſome further thing. Therefore to our faith muſt be joyned our repentance, though not in the making of our peace, yet for the feeling of it. Many are ready to catch at Chriſts bloud, and if that will make a good conſcience they are then ſafe enough. But as thou muſt have Chriſts bloud, ſo Chriſt will have thine heart alſo bleed by repentance, ere he wil vouchſafe the ſenſe of peace. A co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:262:28"/> therefore that would be a conſcience ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving peace, muſt not onely be a <hi>believing,</hi> but a <hi>repenting</hi> conſcience, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ye, for the Kingdome of heaven is at hand,</hi> the Kingdome of heaven ſhall be yours if you will repent, ye ſhall have it immediately upon your repentance. But wherein ſtands this kingdome offered to repentant conſciences? <hi>The Kingdome of God ſtands in peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 14. 17. <hi>Repent, and ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the gift of the holy Gboſt, Act.</hi> 3. 38. And what may that gift be. <hi>The fruits of the Spirit are love, joy, peace, Gal.</hi> 5. 22. Which though it be to be underſtood of peace betweene man and man, yet alſo that peace which is betweene God and man is the fruit of the ſpirit, and <hi>the love of God ſhed abroad into our hearts by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 5. 5. is the gift of the holy Ghoſt, which he gives to all, that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſeeke to get a good conſcience. <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourne,</hi> that is, which repent, <hi>for they ſhalbe comforted, Mat.</hi> 5. 4. they ſhall have the peace of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which is the greateſt and ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt comfort in the world.</p>
                     <p>Many doe truſt all to their ſuppoſed faith, as a ſhort cut and compendious way to a good conſcience, but he whoſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:262:28"/> faith doth not as well purifie the heart as pacifie it, hath neither faith nor a good conſcience. It is idle to hope for peace by faith, whilſt thou liveſt impenitently in a ſinfull courſe. Thou canſt have no peace of conſcience ſo long as thou haſt peace with thy ſins. Peace with conſcience will be had by war with ſin, in the daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of repentance. It it is but a dreame to think of a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience in peace, whilſt a man makes no conſcience of ſin. They that have a good conſcience by Chriſts bloud, may be indeed ſaid to have no conſcience of ſin, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 2. But yet there is a great difference betweene <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> no conſcience, and <hi>making no</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſin. To <hi>have</hi> no conſcience of ſin, is to have a peaceable good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not accuſing of ſin, being ſprinkled with Chriſts blood. To <hi>make</hi> no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſin, is for a man impenitently to live, and ly in any ſin. Now let any judge whether theſe two can ſtand together, that a man may live as he liſt, and <hi>make no conſcience</hi> of any ſin, and yet have ſuch peace by faith as that he <hi>hath no Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of ſin. It is an unconſcionable thing in this ſenſe to lay all upon Chriſt, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable requeſt to have him take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:262:29"/> our guiltineſſe, and yet wee would wallow in our filthineſſe ſtill. How ſhall faith remove the ſting, when repentance removes not the Sin?</p>
                     <p>Men ſeeking peace by faith in Chriſts blood, &amp; yet living and lying in their ſins without repentance, God will give them <hi>Iehues</hi> anſwer to <hi>Iehoram,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>What peace, ſo long as the whoredomes of thy mother Iezebel, and her witchcrafts are ſo many?</hi> So what peace of conſcience, ſo long as thine oathes, Sabbath-breaches, whoredomes, drunkennes, &amp;c. do remain, and remaine, unrepented of, and unrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. It is true of all Sin, which is ſpoken of Romiſh Idolatry, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14. 11. <hi>They have noreſt day nor night;</hi> that is, no peace of conſcience to any of that religion; ſo of all that live in any Sin, they have no true reſt day nor night; that is, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> interprets it, There is no peace to the wicked. Peace and wickedneſſe live not together under one roofe. Wouldſt thou then have a peaceable heart? Get an humbled, a mourning and a repentant heart for Sin. The leſſe peace with Sin, the more peace with God and our owne Conſciences.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The conſtant and conſcionable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:262:29"/> of prayer. An excellent meanes to helpe us to the ſenſe of that peace which makes the conſcience good. Hee that hath a good conſcience will make conſcience of prayer. And prayer will helpe to make a good conſcience better, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>In every thing by prayer and ſupplication with thankſgiving, let your requeſts be made knowne unto God,</hi> and marke what ſhall be the fruit thereof, <hi>And the peace of God that paſſes all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſhall keepe your hearts and minds through Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> See <hi>Iob</hi> 33. 26. <hi>He ſhall pray unto God, and he will be favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto him, and he ſhall ſee his face with joy.</hi> It is many times with mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as it was with <hi>Saul,</hi> hee was vexed and diſquieted with an evill ſpirit; but <hi>Davids</hi> Harpe gave him eaſe: Prayer is a <hi>Davids</hi> Harpe, the muſicke whereof ſweetly calmes, and compoſes a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and diſquieted conſcience, and puts it into frame againe. As in other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets of the heart, after prayer <hi>David</hi> bids his ſoule <hi>returne unto her reſt. Pſ.</hi> 116. 4. 7. So we may in theſe diſquiets of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience do no leſſe.</p>
                     <p>The way to get a good peaceable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is to have acquaintance with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:262:30"/> God; and when wee have acquaintance with him, then ſhall we have peace, <hi>Iob</hi> 22. 21. <hi>Acquaint thy ſelfe now with him, and be at peace.</hi> Now acquaintance is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with God by prayer. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>They ſhall call on my name, and I will heare them; I will ſay, it is my people; and they ſhall ſay, the Lord is my God.</hi> Loe how in prayer acquaintance is bred betweene God and his people, and acquaintance breedes love, and peace; and peace a good Conſcience. Iudge then what piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſcience they muſt needs have, that make ſo little conſcience of ſeeking God in this duty; of wicked ones the <hi>Pſalme</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>They call not upon God, Pſal.</hi> 14. as much as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſayes, There is no peace to the wicked, they are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voyd of good Conſcience.</p>

                        <hi>faith is Sin,</hi> Rom. 14. 23. That is, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a man doth, and hath not warrant for it out of, and from the rule of the Word, makes a mans conſcience in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to be evill. And therefore, v. 5. <hi>Let a man be fully perſwaded in his owne mind.</hi> How happy ſhould men be in getting and keeping good conſciences, if they would lay their lives &amp; actions to the Rule. The want of this is it that makes men, men of ſo ill conſciences. Some live by no Rule, ſome by falſe Rules; &amp; hence come mens conſciences to be ſo Anomalous. Some live by no Rule, but doe whatſoever ſeemes good in their owne eyes, goe as their luſts lead them, and follow his beck that rules in the Ayre. This is alſo to <hi>walk raſhly,</hi> Lev. 26. He that doth things without rule, goes raſhly to worke. Hee that walkes irregularly, walkes raſhly, and no marvell if men have crooked wayes, and crooked conſciences, when they will not live by Rule.

If this courſe were taken, ſuch a good courſe would make and keep a good Conſcience. And why ſhould not men be willing to take this courſe; why will we not make that Word our Rule, which muſt be made our Iudge? <hi>The word which I ſpeak ſhall judge you in the laſt day,</hi> Ioh. 12. 48. The Word ſhall judge
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:262:32"/> our conſciences, therfore let it rule, and order them. And if it have the ruling of our conſciences, it will make them good conſciences, and when they are good they need not feare what Iudge they come before, nor what judgement they undergoe. In ſumme, if we would have good conſciences, we muſt make more conſcience than is commonly made of reading, and ſearching the Scriptures. The ignorance and neglect of this duty is it which banes ſo many conſciences in the world. <note place="margin">Integritatis tuae curioſus explorator vitam tuam in quotidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na diſcuſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne examina.

                     <p>The firſt ſtep to get a good conſcience, is for a man to know that his conſcience before reformation is evill. How ſhall that be knowne without a ſearch? When a ſearch hath diſcovered what it is that makes the conſcience, and courſe evill, then will Conſcience be ready to labour a man to the reformation of that which is amiſſe, and will not ceaſe to urge, and ply a man till it be done. Frequent examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as it helps to the making of Scholars, ſo to the making of Conſciences good. Hence mens lying in ſo groſſe neglects of good duties, in ſo many great evils, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men and their conſciences never reckon. Men take not themſelves aſide into their cloſets and chambers, and there ſet not up a privie Seſſions to make inquiry into their own hearts and wayes, and therefore are their wayes and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſo much out of order. Many a man thinks his eſtate in the world to be very good, and thinkes hee growes rich and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:262:33"/> wealthy, when his eſtate indeed is weak, and growes every day worſe than other. Now what is it that cauſes ſo great a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake? Nothing but this, that hee never lookes over his bookes nor caſts over his reckonings. If he had done this, he ſhould have ſeene that his eſtate was not anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to his conceit, and the knowledge of his miſconceit would have made him have lived at a more wary, and thrifty rate, and have kept himſelfe within ſuch a compaſſe as might have kept up his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, whereas now the not examining his books, puts him into a conceit of wealth, and this conceit beggers and undoes him. It fares no better with too many in their Conſciences. <hi>Laodicea</hi> thought well of her ſelfe, <hi>Thou ſayeſt, I am rich.</hi> If ſhe had examined her conſcience, ſhe ſhould have ſeene that which Chriſt ſaw, that ſhe was poore, blind, naked, and miſerable, and the ſight of this would have made her to have ſought after that counſell which Chriſt there gives her, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. Men would have far better conſciences if they knew in what ill caſe their Conſciences ſtand, and examination would help them to the knowledge of this. If men would but over-looke the booke of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:262:34"/> and ſee how many omiſſions of good, how many ſinfull co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſions ſtand regiſtred there, it would both make them marvellous ſollicitous how to get them wiped out, and wondrous wary how any more ſuch Items came there.

Doe thou ſo, not onely at the weekes end, at thy lives end, ſearch thine heart, and examine thy courſe, but at every dayes end looke backe into the day paſt, and examine what thy carriage and behaviour hath beene. This being done, a man ſhall find his workes either good or evill. If good, how ſhall his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cheere him with its peace?

Sometime if a man ſpeake, hee may have rough and angry anſwers, as the Prophet had from <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 16. <hi>Art thou made of the Kings Counſell? forbeare, why ſhouldſt thou be ſmitten?</hi> God hath therefore provided every man even great men which may not be ſpoken to, he hath provided them a boſome Chaplein, that will round them in the eare, and will talk roundly to them, one that will be of their counſell in deſpight of them; one that feares no fiſts, dreads no ſmiting, yea, one that fears not to ſmite the greateſt, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10. <hi>And Davids heart ſmote him after that he had numbred the people.</hi> It may be

                     <p>Gods Miniſters are oft ſlighted, and light ſet by, preachers ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be regarded, but God hath given men a Preacher in their own boſom, and this Preacher will make many a curtain ſermon, wil take men to task upon their pillow, &amp; will be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching over our Sermons againe to them. And though many will not be brought to repetition of Sermons in their Families, yet they have a Repeater in their boſom, that will be at private repetitions with them in ſpite of them, and will tell them, This is not according to that you have been taught, you have been taught other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; you have been reproved for, and convinced of this ſinne in the publicke Miniſterie, &amp;c. Why doe not you hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and reforme? Thus then conſcience having a voyce, and doing the office of a Preacher unto us, if wee would have

                     <p>Now then that which I ayme at, is this; If we would get and keepe a good

                     <p>Againe, doth thy conſcience rebuke thee, doth it chide and check thee, doth thy heart <hi>reproach thee for thy wayes?</hi> doth it ſay, doeſt thou well to live in ſuch and ſuch Sins?

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:262:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> with conſcience, and doe thou accuſe thy ſelfe as faſt as it accuſes, acknowledge thy folly, yield, promiſe, and covenant with thy conſcience a preſent and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reformation. This if it were done, how happy ſhould men be in getting and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a good conſcience.</p>
                     <p>But alas, how few regard the voyce of Conſcience, and once hearken to it, and the very want of this duty is it which breeds ſo much ill conſcience in the world. Men in this caſe are guilty of a double wickedneſſe. Either they deale as the Iewes with the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 18. and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 16. They either <hi>ſtop conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences mouth,</hi> and labour to ſilence this Preacher, or elſe they deale with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as the Iews did with <hi>Stephen, Act.</hi> 7. 57. <hi>They ſtopped their eares.</hi> If they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtop conſciences mouth, they will at leaſt ſtop their owne eares.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 They labour to ſtop conſciences mouth. If conſcience begin to take them aſide, and to ſay to them, as <hi>Ehud</hi> to <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon; Iudg.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>I have a ſecret errand unto thee:</hi> they anſwer, but in another ſenſe, as hee did; <hi>Keepe ſilence.</hi> If con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience offer to be talking unto them, they ſhufflle it off as <hi>Felix</hi> did <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:262:39"/> they are not at leaſure, they will finde ſome other time when their leaſure will better ſerve. Yea many when their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences reproach them, they againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and reprove it, and anſwer it as the <hi>Danites</hi> did <hi>Micah, Iudges</hi> 11. 23. <hi>What ayleth thee?</hi> and are ready to give reproachfull language to their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that it cannot be quiet and let them alone.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 But yet Conſcience will not of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be thus poſted and ſhuffled off, will not bee gagged, or ſuffer her lips to bee ſown up, but will deale with a man as the woman of Canaan did with our Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 15. She would not be put off with neglect, or croſſe anſwers, but ſhe ſtil preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon our Saviour, and grows ſo much the more importunat. So oftentimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience when ſhe ſees men ſhuffle, growes the more importunate, and will dog and haunt men ſo much the more. Yea it deals like the blind men, <hi>Math.</hi> 20. 31. who when the multitude rebuked them, <hi>they cryed the more.</hi> Now then when conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence growes thus clamorous, and will not be ſilenced, then they will ſtop their owne eares, that if it will needs be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, it ſhall but tell a tale to a deafe man.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:262:39"/> To this end men put a double tricke upon their conſciences.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>Sauls trick. Saul</hi> is vexed with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill ſpirit, what muſt be the cure? ſeeke him out a minſtrell. Thus many, when the cry of conſcience is up, betake them to their merriments and jollities. They try whether the noiſe of the Harps, and Viols, and the roarings of good fellowes will not drowne the voyce and noiſe of conſcience. They will try whether the dinne of an Ale-houſe, or the ratling and clattering of the Dice and Tables cannot deafe their eares againſt the clamours of conſcience. Thus doe many in the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of conſcience, give themſelves wholly up to all manner of pleaſures and delights, that ſo their minds being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with them, there might bee no leaſure to give conſcience any the leaſt audience.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Cains trick. Cain</hi> had a mark of God upon him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 15. And what might that marke be? <hi>Chryſostome</hi> thinks it was a continuall ſhaking and trembling of his <note place="margin">

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:262:40"/> and cry for murther, and reproching him for a bloody murtherer. How-ever, no queſtion but his conſcience continually haunted him, and the cry of blood was ever in his eares. Now then what courſe takes he? ye ſhall ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 17. That hee falls a building of Cities, betakes himſelfe to a multitude of imployments, that the noiſe of the ſawes, axes, and mallets, might be lowder then the noiſe of his Conſcience. If Conſcience bee out of quiet with them, &amp; will not ceaſe to urge and pinch them, then have among their ſheepe, and oxen, that their bleating, and bellowing may keepe under the voice of conſcience, they do ſo poſſeſſe their heads and their thoughts, and ſo overload them with much dealings in the world, that there is no ſpare time wherein their eare can be free to heare the voice of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The clutter of their many buſineſſes make too great a noyſe for Conſcience to have audience. They deale with their conſciences as the <hi>Epheſians</hi> dealt with <hi>Alexander, Act.</hi> 19. 33. 34. <hi>And Alexander beckned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people. But when they knew that he was a Iew, all with one voice about the ſpace of two houres cryed out,</hi>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:262:40"/> 
                        <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians.</hi> If <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> had had never ſo good lungs, and ſtrong ſides hee might have ſtrained his voyce till hee had crazed the organs of language, and might have ſpoken till he had been hoarſe againe, before he could have beene heard to have ſpoken one ſyllable, though he had ſpoken all the reaſon in the world. Such a noiſe of an outragious bellowing multitude had bin almoſt enough to have drownd the voice of a Canon. Thus deale men with their conſcience, if ſhe but prepare to ſpeak and give but a becke with the hand, preſently thruſt themſelves into a crowd of buſines that may out-cry and over-cry the baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling noiſe therof. It was an hideous noiſe that the ſhricking infants of Iſrael made when they were offred up alive in fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Moloch.</hi> Now leſt their parents bowels ſhould earne with compaſſion, and be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the ſhrickes of their poore babes, therfore they had their drums and trumpets ſtrucke up and ſounded in the time of ſacrifice, to make ſuch a noiſe, that in no caſe the lamentable cryes of the infants ſhould be heard. The ſame trick do too many put upon their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, if they will be clamouring, they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:262:41"/> will have ſome Drum or other, whoſe greater noiſe may deafe their eares from hearing the cries of conſcience.</p>
                     <p>But alas what poore projects are theſe? The time will come when men ſhall have neither pleaſures nor profits, neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights nor buſineſſe, to ſtop their eares. Though now men beate upon theſe Drum-heads, and with the noiſe of their pleaſures and profits keepe conſcience voice under from being heard, yet the day will come, when God will beat out theſe Drum-heads, and then the cries and horrid and hideous ſhrickes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall bee heard: God will one day ſtrip thee of all thy pleaſures and imployments, and will turne thee ſingle and looſe to thy conſcience, and it ſhall have full liberty to bait thee, and bite thee at pleaſure. Oh how much better is it to be willing to hearken to the voice of Conſcience here, than to be forced to heare it in hell, when the time of hearkning will be paſt and gone. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to it now, and thou ſhalt not heare it hereafter. Hearken to the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and reproofes of it now; and thus ſhall thou get Integrity here, and ſhalt be free from hearing the dolefull cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:262:41"/> of it in hell hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. To get and keepe a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ever in caſes of a doubtfull and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable nature, be ſure to take the ſureſt ſide. Many things are of a queſtionable nature, and much may bee ſaid on either ſide; in ſuch caſes, if thou wouldſt have a good Conſcience, take the ſureſt ſide, that ſide on which thou mayſt be ſure thou ſhalt not ſinne. As for example. There be divers games and recreations whoſe lawfulneſſe are queſtioned, yet much may be ſaid for them, and poſſibly they may have the judgement of divers reverend and learned men for their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe. Now what ſhall a man doe in this caſe? Take the ſure ſide. If I uſe them it is poſſible I may ſinne, it may be they are not ſinnefull, yet I am not ſo ſure of it that I ſhall not ſinne if I uſe them, as I am ſure I ſhall not ſin if I doe not uſe them. I am ſure that not to uſe ſuch ſports breakes none of Gods commandements, a man may bee bold to build upon that. <note place="margin">Tutiores igi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur vivimus ſi totum Deo daraus, non autem nos il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li ex parte, &amp; nobis ex parte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittimus. <hi>Aug. de dono perſev. cap.</hi> 6.</note> He that lives by this rule, ſhall keepe his Conſcience from many a flaw.

Remarkable in this kind is that dealing of the <hi>Iewes</hi> with <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24. <hi>Of the Iewes five times received I forty ſtripes ſave one.</hi> If we looke into the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 1, 2, 3. it runs thus, <hi>If there be a controverſie, &amp;c. and it ſhall be if the wicked man be worthy to be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the Iudge ſhall cauſe him to lye downe, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certaine number, forty ſtripes hee may give him, and not exceed.</hi> Now ſee the good conſciences of theſe <hi>Iewes,</hi> they might give forty ſtripes, but not beyond that number might they goe. Now they make ſo much conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of exceeding the number of forty; that they give <hi>Paul</hi> but nine and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thus they make conſcience of the number, but no conſcience of the fact;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:262:46"/> They make conſcience of giving above fortie, but with what conſcience doe they give him any at all? The Text not onely preſcribes the number of ſtripes, but the condition of the perſon, namely, that he be <hi>worthy to be beaten,</hi> and he muſt be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <hi>according to his fault.</hi> Now ſee theſe men make Conſcience of the law for the number, but make no conſcience of the Law, that will have onely wicked men, and ſuch as are worthy to be beaten, to be ſo uſed. Theſe be the conſciences of wicked men, they make ſeeme of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king conſcience in ſome one thing, but make no conſcience of ten others, it may be, of farre greater weight and neceſſity, and herein diſcover they the naughtineſſe of their conſciences. The conſcience therefore is not to be judged good for one, or ſome good actions. <hi>Ioab</hi> turned not after <hi>Abſolom,</hi> but hee turned after <hi>Adoniah.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 28. Whereas a good conſcience that turnes neither to the right hand not the left, would have turned neither after <hi>Adoniah</hi> nor <hi>Abſolom.</hi> A good conſcience and a good converſation muſt goe together. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Having a good Conſcience, that they may be aſhamed that falſly accuſe your good converſation.</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:262:46"/> One good action makes not a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, nor a good conſcience, but then a mans converſation may be ſaid to be good, when in his whole courſe he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to do all good duties, and to avoyd all ſinnes, and ſuch a good converſation is a ſigne of good Conſcience. <note place="margin">Nunc autem in hoc maior offenſa eſt quod partem ſententiae ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crae pro com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modorum noſtrorum u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitate deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimus, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem pro dei iniuria prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terimus, Et maxime cum &amp; terreſtres domini ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaquam ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo animo tolerandum putent ſi iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiones ſuas ſerui ex parte audiant &amp; ex parte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnant.

A good ſervants commendation is to do all his Maſters buſineſſe hee enjoynes him. Wee would hold him but an holy-day ſervant, and an idle companion, that when his maſter hath ſet him his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall workes to doe, hee will doe which him pleaſes, and leave the other undone. This were not to doe his maſters, but to doe his owne will, and to ſerve his owne turne rather then his maſters: So for a man to make choyce of duties, and to picke out ſome particulars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee will yeeld obedience to God, and to paſſe by others as not ſtanding with his profits, pleaſures, and luſts, this will never gaine a man the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a good conſcience, whoſe goodnes

                     <p n="2">2. To make conſcience of ſmall Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſmall ſinnes. This alſo riſes out of the Text. <hi>All good Conſcience.</hi> If of <hi>all</hi> things, then of <hi>ſmall</hi> things. It might have beene comprehended under the former, but yet for Conviction ſake I diſtinguiſh them. The good conſcience makes not conſcience onely of great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſinnes, but even of the leaſt, knowing that as Gods great power and omnipotence is the ſame in the making of an Angell and a worme, ſo Gods au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, wiſedome and holineſſe is the ſame in the leaſt Commandements, as in the greateſt of them all. It makes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſpecially of Judgement, and the weighty matters of the law, but yet doth not therefore thinke it ſelfe diſcharged of all care in ſmaller things, doth not thereupon challenge a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation from obedience in meaner matters, as if it were needleſſe ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity, as too much preciſeneſſe to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:262:47"/> ty the Mint, Aniſe, and Cummin. A Cummin-ſeede indeede is but a ſmall thing, a very toy, but yet as ſmall a thing, and as light as it is, yet will it ly heavie upon a good conſcience, being injuriouſly and fraudulently detayned from the Levites. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> tythed Mint, Aniſe, and Cummin, but they neglected the weighty matters of the Law. It is no good conſcience that lookes to ſmall, and neglects great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, neither is it a good conſcience on the other ſide, that lookes after the great and weighty duties, and makes no rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of Mint and Aniſe. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſayes both ought to bee done. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> could bee content that the people ſhould goe Sacrifice, but hee cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould bee ſo peeviſhly preciſe, that not an hoofe ſhould be left behind. Alas, an hoofe is but a toy, not worth the mentioning, what need <hi>Moſes</hi> bee ſo ſtrict as to ſtand upon an hoofe? Yet a good conſcience will ſtand upon it, having Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and will make conſcience as well of carrying away hoofes as of whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Cattell. It is with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as it is with the apple of the eye,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:262:48"/> of all the parts of the body it is the moſt tender, not onely of ſome great ſhives, or ſplints under the eye-lid, but even the ſmalleſt haire and duſt grieves and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends it. It is ſo with a tender good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, not onely beames, but alſo moates diſquiet the eye of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and not onely greater, and fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Sinnes, but even ſuch as the world counts veniall trifles doe offend it. A good conſcience ſtraines not onely at a Camell, but at a Gnat alſo. Neither doth our Saviour blame the Phariſees ſimply for ſtraining at a Gnat, but for their hypocriſie, who would pretend conſcience in ſmaller things, and meane while made none in the greater; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe a good conſcience indeed hath a narrow paſſage for a Gnat, as well as for a Camell. The leaſt corne of gravell galls his foot that hath a ſtrait ſhooe, but hee that hath a large, wide ſhooe, ſlop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping about his foot, it is no trouble to him. It is juſt ſo with conſciences good and evill.</p>

A good conſcience will not give ſo much as a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing token to ſuch an uſe, as little a thing as it is. <hi>For he that is faithfull in that which is leaſt, is faithfull alſo in much, and he that is unjuſt in the leaſt, is unjuſt alſo in much,</hi> Luke 16. 10. Even the leaſt things are as great trials of a good conſcience, as the greateſt. A good Conſcience will not greatifie Satan, nor neglect God, no not in a little.</p>
                     <p>Put mens conſciences now vpon this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Who crakes not of his good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? there be none, if they may bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, but they have good Conſciences. But why are they good? They can ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no Camells. Well, yeeld them that, though if their entrals were well ſearcht, a man might finde huge bunch backt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mells, that have gone downe their gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:262:49"/> They can ſwallow no camells, but what ſay they to gnats, can they ſwallow them? Tuſh, Gnats are nothing, whole ſwarmes of them can goe downe their throats, and they never once cough for the matter. Foule and groſſe ſcandalls, ſuch as are infamous amongſt meere hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, ſuch Camells they ſwallow not, but what ſay they to unſavorie and naughtie thoughts which their hearts proſecute with delight, what ſay they to them? Gnats doe not ſwarme more abundantly in the fennes, then ſuch vile thoughts doe in their hearts. The prodigious oaths of wounds, blood, the damned language of Ruffians, and the Monſters of the earth, Oh their hearts would tremble to have ſuch words paſſe out of their mouths, but yet what ſay they to the neater, and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified Complements of Faith and Troth? Tuſh theſe are trifles, meere Gnats, alas, that you ſhall ſtand upon ſuch niceties. To rob a man upon the high way, or to breake up a mans houſe in the night, this is a monſtrous Camell, but in buying and ſelling to over-reach a neighbour a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or two, a penny or two, what ſay they to that? Oh God forbid they ſhould be ſo ſtrictly dealt withall, that is a ſmall
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:262:50"/> thing, their throats are not ſo narrow, but theſe Gnats will goe downe eaſily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. To beare falſe witneſſe in an open Court of Iuſtice, or to be guilty of pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory-perjury, theſe bee foule things, but to lye a little for a mans advantage or to make another man merriment, what thinke they of this? This is a very Gnat, they are aſhamed to ſtraine thereat. Tell many a man of his ſinne in which he lyes, that his ſinne and a good conſcience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand together, what is his anſwer, but as <hi>Lot</hi> of <hi>Zoar, Is it not a little one. Gen.</hi> 19. 20, But the truth is, that theſe little ones are great evidences of evill conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It is but a dreame to thinke our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences good, that make no conſcience of ſmall ſinnes and duties.</p>
                     <p>The conſcionable <hi>Nazarite,</hi> now, did not only make conſcience of guzling and quaffing whole cups of wine, but of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but an huske, and a kernell of a Grape. What a trifle is the kernell of a Grape, and yet a good conſcience will care to pleaſe God as well in abſtinence from the kernell, as from the cup. Indeed when <hi>David</hi> had defiled and hardned his conſcience with his adultery, then hee could cut <hi>Vriahs</hi> throat, and his heart
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:262:50"/> ſmites him not for it, but when under his affliction his conſcience was tender and good, his heart ſmites him but for cutting <hi>Sauls</hi> coat, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 5. See the nature of a good conſcience, it will ſmile not onely for cutting <hi>Sauls</hi> throat, but for cutting <hi>Sauls</hi> coat, but for an appearance, vpon a ſuſpicion, and but a iealouſie of evill.</p>

And this is that which differences civility and a good Conſcience, Civility ſhunnes mire, but is not ſo trim as to waſh off ſpots, this is the pure Religion of a pure Conſcience. <hi>Pure Religion and nnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed is to keep a mans ſelfe unſpotted,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they who are not unſpoted, are not undefiled, but if their conſciences be but ſpotted, yet are they defiled.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:262:51"/> pure Religion is ſpotleſſe.</p>
                     <p>Yea to cloſe this point, the greateſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of a good conſcience is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Conſcience of ſmall things.

This then is a note of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to make Conſcience, as of ſmall duties, ſo of ſmall ſinnes; as hee that feares poiſon, feares to take a drop, as well as a draught, and men feare not onely when a firebrand is thruſt into, but when a ſparke lights upon their thatch.</p>

The Word is the rule of conſcience, and a good conſcience is deſirous to know the rule it muſt live by. The Word muſt judge the conſcience, this every good conſcience knowes, and therefore grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges not to be reproved by it, as knowing that if it will not abide the Words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, it muſt abide the Words iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Now when the conſcience upon juſt information from the Word, ſhall preſſe, and forbid, and then a man ſhall, becauſe conſcience forbids, forbeare, or becauſe it preſſes, performe obedience: thus to doe good, or not to doe evill, for conſcience ſake, is a note of a good conſcience.

                        </note> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. When a man <hi>for conſcience towards God endures griefe, ſuffering wrong.</hi> A good conſcience had rather that <hi>Ananias</hi> ſhould ſmite, then it ſelfe ſhould. <hi>Ananias</hi> his blowes are nothing to the blowes of conſcience. <hi>Ananias</hi> may make <hi>Pauls</hi> cheekes glow, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:262:58"/> gives ſuch terrible buffets, as will make the ſtouteſt heart in the world to ake. That will pinch, and twitch and gird the heart with ſuch griping throwes, that all the blowes, and tortures that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> his cruell heart can invent are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore a man that ſets any ſtore by a good conſcience, will not part with the Peace or Integrity thereof upon any termes. Hee rates the goodneſſe of his conſcience far above al earthly things. Wealth, liberty, wife, children, life it ſelfe, all are vile, and cheape in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it. And therefore a man of a good conſcience will endure any griefe, and ſuffer any wrong to keepe his conſcience good towards God. Such a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience had <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in his heart that hee would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file himſelfe with the portion of the Kings meat.</hi> That is, he was fully ſetled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, come what would come, he would not do that which would not ſtand with a good conſcience. But what if it could have gotten no other meat? without all doubt he would rather have ſtarved than have defiled his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with that meat. Hee would have
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:262:58"/> loſt his life, rather than have loſt the Peace, and Integrity of his conſcience. It ſeemes a queſtion of great difficulty, which was put to the three Children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. Whether they will give the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their bodies to the golden Idoll, or the burning of their bodies to the fiery Furnace. But yet they find no ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty therin, they were not carefull to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in that matter, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Of the two fires they choſe the cooleſt, &amp; the eaſieſt. The fire of a guilty conſcience is ſeven times hotter, and more intolerable than the fire of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Furnace, though it be heated ſeven times more then it is wont to be heated.</p>
                     <p>If the queſtion come betweene life and good conſcience, that one of the two muſt be parted withall, it is an hard caſe. Life is wondrous ſweet and precious. Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life, <hi>Iob</hi> 2. 4. What then ſhould a man do in ſuch a hard caſe? Heare what is the reſolution of a good conſcience, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 24. <hi>My life not deare unto me, ſo that I may fulfill my Miniſtration with joy.</hi> And wherein lay his joy, but in his good conſcience, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1. 12. It is all one as if hee had ſaid, I care not to loſe my
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:262:59"/> life to keepe a good conſcience. A good conſcience in that paſſage of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19. is ſecretly compared to a ſhip. Now in a tempeſt at Sea, when the queſtion is come to this, whether the goods ſhall be caſt out, or the Ship be caſt away, what doe the Marriners? See <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 18. 38. <hi>They lightned the Ship, and caſt out the wheat into the Sea.</hi> The Marriners will turne the richeſt Commodities over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board to ſave the Ship, for they know if the Ship be caſt away, then themſelves are caſt away. Thus it is with a man that hath a good conſcience, when the caſe comes to this pinch, that either his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Comforts, or his inward Peace muſt wrack, hee will cheerfully <hi>caſt the wheat into the ſea:</hi> will part with all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commodities and comforts, before he will ruſh, and wrack his conſcience upon any rock. He knowes if the ſhip be wrackt if his conſcience be crackt, that then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his ſoule is in danger of being caſt away, and therefore hee will throw away all to ſave conſcience from being ſplit upon the rocks, and being ſwallowed up in the ſands.</p>
                     <p>There is as great a difference between a good conſcience, and all outward things
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:262:59"/> even unto life it ſelfe, as is betweene the arme, and the head or heart. The braine and the heart are vitall parts, therefore when the head is in danger to be cleft, or the heart to be thruſt through, a man will not ſtand queſtioning whether hee were beſt adventure his hand, or his arme to ſave his head, or his heart, but either of theſe being in danger, the hand and the arme preſently interpoſe themſelves to receive the blow, and put themſelves in danger of being wounded, or cut off; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the head or heart ſhould be pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. A man may have his hand, or arme cut off, and yet may live, but a wound in the braine or heart is mortall. It is ſo in this caſe. A good conſcience values its owne peace above all the world. It is that wherin a Chriſtians life lyes, therfore he will ſuffer the right hand or foot to be cut off, and loſe all rather than expoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to danger. A man may go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the loſſe of a limbe, and though he halt, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 8. but if a man loſe his life, if conſcience be loſt, all is loſt. A man may goe to heaven though hee loſe riches, liberty, life, but if a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be loſt, there is no comming thither. All things compared to conſcience are as

He were a mad man that would ſuffer his skull to be cleft to ſave his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle finger, nay but the paring of his naile. And yet the world is full of ſuch mad men, that ſuffer conſcience to receive many a deepe wound and gaſh, to ſave thoſe things which in compariſon of good conſcience, are but as the nayle pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings to the head.</p>
                     <p>Try mens conſciences here, and we ſhall find them exceeding ſhort. A good conſcience will endure any griefe, and ſuffer any wrong rather then ſuffer the loſſe of its owne peace. God commands <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 Chron. 25. to put away <hi>Iſrael,</hi> oh! but <hi>what ſhall I doe for mine hundred Talents?</hi> Tuſh, what are an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Talents? A good conſcience in yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding obedience to God is a richer trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure than the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indies.</hi> And yet how many be there that will craze their conſcience an hundred times before they will loſe one Talent by obedience to God, out of a care to keepe a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. A talent; nay, that is too deepe, never put them to that coſt, they will ſell a good conſcience, not for gaining, but for the taking of a farthing token. God and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:262:61"/> good conſcience ſay, <hi>Sanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi> Poſſibly ſome halfe-penny cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer comes to a Tradeſmans Shop on a Sabbath, and askes the ſale of ſuch, or ſuch a commoditie. Now the mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tels him of the commandement, tels him what God lookes for, tels him it cannot ſtand with his peace to make markets on that day, &amp;c. But then he tels conſcience, that if hee be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, hee may loſe a cuſtomer, and if hee loſe his cuſtomers, he may ſhutte up his Shop-windowes. An Inne-keepers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tels him that it is fitter that hee ſhould bee attending Gods ſervice at his houſe on his day, than that hee ſhould be waiting on his gueſt. But then he replies to conſcience, that then his takings will be but poore, and this is the next way to pluck downe his ſigne. So here lyes a diſpute between Conſcience and Gaine, which of theſe two muſt be parted with. If now in this caſe a man will grow to this reſolution; By Gods helpe I am reſolved to keepe a good conſcience in keeping Gods Commandement and Sabbath, I will rather loſe the beſt cuſtomer I have, and the beſt gueſt I have, then the peace of a good conſcience. If I beg, I beg;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:262:62"/> I will ſay of my cuſtomers as <hi>Iacob</hi> of his children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43. 14. <hi>If I am bereaved of them, I am bereaved.</hi> I will truſt God with my eſtate, before I will hazard my conſcience; Give me ſuch a man, ſuch a Tradeſman, and I will be bold to ſay he is a man of a good conſcience. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, when men are ſo ſet upon gaine, that ſo they may have it, they care not how they come by it, they will diſpenſe an hundred times with their obedience to God if any thing be to be had, if theſe have good conſciences let any judge. How would ſuch loſe their blood and lives, that will not loſe ſuch trifling gaines for the ſafety of their conſcience? Wee <hi>have not yet reſiſted unto blood,</hi> the more we owe to God, that know not what that reſiſtance meanes. Alas, how would thoſe reſiſt unto blood that ſet conſcience to ſale upon ſo baſe prices as they doe.</p>

                     <p>Now put mens conſciences upon this triall, &amp; their inconſtancie either in good cauſes, or courſes, will diſcover their naughtines.

They hold out well till there come a tentation on their left hand, that is, in their right hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. 8. <hi>Whoſe mouth ſpeakes vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falſhood.</hi> If once the right hand be a right hand of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the mouth will ſoone ſpeake vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though before it ſpeake conſcience. Who would not have thought <hi>Balaam</hi> to have beene a man of an excellent conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? <hi>If Balak would give mee his houſe full of ſilver and gold, I cannot goe beyond the word of the Lord my God, to doe leſſe or more, Num.</hi> 22. 18. But yet beſides that faltering in thoſe words <hi>I cannot goe,</hi> whereas the language of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would have beene, <hi>I will not goe;</hi> beſides that I ſay, before hee ends his ſpeech, ſee how the hope of promotions works, and works his conſcience like wax before the fire, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Now therfore I pray you tarry heere alſo this night, that I may know what the Lord will ſay unto me more.</hi>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:262:68"/> A faltering inference: If his conſcience had beene good, it would have inferred ſtrongly thus; Now therefore I pray get you gone, and trouble me no longer. Hee knew in his conſcience the people ought not to be curſed, and that he ought not to goe, and yet comes in with <hi>I pray tarry all night, &amp;c.</hi> Truly <hi>Balak</hi> needed not to have beene ſo laviſh and ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, as to offer an houſe full, one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his ſilver and gold will frame <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi> conſcience to any thing.</p>
                     <p>The like triall may be made of mens conſciences, by their <hi>inconſtancie</hi> in good courſes, and this will condemne three ſorts, as guilty of evill conſciences.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Such as ſometimes being convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the neceſſity of good cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, doe ſet upon the practice of them, and begin to looke towards Religion, and religious duties, till meeting with ſome of their ſuppoſed wiſer neighbours, they be adviſed to take heed, they may bring themſelves into greater note then they are aware of, they will incur ſharper cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures then they thinke of, &amp;c. and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly all is daſht, all is quaſht and quencht. There is a diſeaſe among beaſts they call the <hi>Staggers,</hi> and it is a diſeaſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:262:69"/> too frequent in mens Conſciences, who ſometimes are on, ſometimes off, one day begin, and next day ceaſe good courſes. That may be ſaid of many mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which <hi>Iacob</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>Reuben, Gen,</hi> 49. 4. <hi>Vnſtable as water.</hi> The water moues as the winds blow. If the wind blow out of the Eaſt, then it moves one way; if out of the weſt, then it moves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, the cleane contrary, and upon every new winde a new way. So many, let them heare a convincing, and a good perſwading Sermon moving to good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then they will ſet upon them; let them againe heare either ſome mocks, or reproches for thoſe wayes, or ſome ſage adviſe from one they count wiſe, againſt the way of conſcience, they are as far off againe as ever. Theſe ſtaggering, irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and watry Conſciences are farre from good ones.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such as in their youth, or when the world was low with them, were very zealous and forward; But what are they now at this day? True downeright <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſes,</hi> zealous when they were young, but now old and cold: zealous when they were meane, but now the world is come vpon them, <hi>Demas-</hi>like they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken

                     <p n="3">3. Thoſe that have made good the prophane Proverb, <hi>Young Saints and old Devills,</hi> whoſe hatred of Religion and good conſcience is greater then ever was their love thereto, as <hi>Ammon</hi> was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Thamar,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 15. They were zealous and forward frequenters of Gods houſe and Ordinances; zealous enemies againſt Swearing, and Sabbath-breaking, &amp;c.

They dealt with their Conſciences as Colleges deale with Rake-hels, expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them without all hope of re-entry. Thus many prophane Apoſtating back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders cannot be content to loſe good conſcience, unleſſe <hi>Ammon-</hi>like they may put it away with violence, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it. And how can they have good conſcience that have put it away? Hee hath not his wife, that hath put her away, and given her a bill of divorce. In the dayes of Popery and darkneſſe, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill it ſeemed walked very familiarly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and hence we have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtories of Fayries, and of children ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of cradles, and others laid in their roomes, whom they called <hi>Changelings.</hi>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:262:70"/> Since the light of the Goſpell, theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and Fayries have not beene ſeene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, but yet we are ſtill troubled with <hi>Changelings.</hi> Some, Prieſts and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites have changed; ſome, the world hath changed; ſome, Good-fellowſhip and the Ale-houſe hath changed.

                     <p>In all theſe, or in any of theſe times it is good to have ſuch a friend or companion
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:262:71"/> that will ſticke to a man, and be faithfull <note place="margin">Interim eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge ſocium qui cum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia ſubtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta fuerint fidem ſervat dilectoribus ſuis nec re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedit in te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        </note> to him when all other things faile him. Such a friend, and ſuch a companion, is a good conſcience. <hi>A friend loves at all times, and a brother is borne for adverſitie. Proverb.</hi> 17. 17. But in ſome of theſe caſes a brother and friend may be falſe, and will not, or may be weake and cannot helpe nor pleaſure a man, but a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is better then all friends and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren whatſoever; when they will not, or cannot, or may not, yet then will a good conſcience ſticke cloſe to a man, and be a ſure friend to him. Let us ſee in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars the truth of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the time and caſe of <hi>Diſgrace, Infamie, Reproach,</hi> and wrongs of that <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in caſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and reproach.</note> kinde, the comfort and benefit of a good conſcience is unſpeakeable. When a man ſhall be traduced, ſlandered, falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſed and condemned, then in ſuch wrongs will a good conſcience doe the office of a faithfull friend, will ſticke to, and ſtand by a man, and will comfort and hearten him againſt all ſuch injuries. <hi>Paul</hi> is heere conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before the Councell as a Malefactor, hee hath an whole Councell bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. What now is his comfort,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:262:72"/> and his defence againſt ſuch an heape of accuſers as doe affront him? This it is, <hi>Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conſcience.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, Impeach, traduce, accuſe and condemne mee as you pleaſe, yet be it knowne unto you, that I have a good conſcience, and this my good conſcience is it which ſhall comfort and uphold me againſt all your injurious and unequall proceedings. You may bring forth falſe witneſſes againſt me, but my conſcience doth, and will witneſſe for me, you may condemne me, yet my conſcience acquits, and abſolves me. And thus doth <hi>Paul</hi> ſhelter himſelfe under his good conſcience.</p>
                     <p>The like we may ſee in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Ananias</hi> and the Elders come and bring <hi>Tertullus,</hi> and he is feed to be <hi>Pauls</hi> accuſer, and he layes heavie and hainous things to <hi>Pauls</hi> charge, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Wee have found this man a peſtilent fellow, and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of ſedition among all the Iews through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, a ring-leader of the ſect of the Nazarens, &amp;c.</hi> Here be foule things, what will <hi>Paul</hi> be able to ſay to all this? Will not this bee enough to ſinke him downe utterly, to ſee ſo many banded together, and ſuch great ones combined
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:262:72"/> to countenance ſuch an accuſation? How will he be able to ſubſiſt? Now then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the benefit, and comfort of a good conſcience. He holds up his former buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kler, and ſmites <hi>Ananias,</hi> and the reſt with his former weapon, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>Herein doe I exerciſe my ſelfe, to have alwaies a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience voyd of offence towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men. Ananias</hi> and the Elders have a mercenary <hi>Tertullus</hi> to accuſe him, <hi>Paul</hi> hath no man dares be ſeene to plead for him, none will be retained in his cauſe, but yet now conſcience ſteps out, and ſtops the foule mouth of this ſlanderous Oratour, and puts ſpirit, and heart into <hi>Paul</hi> to plead his own Cauſe againſt them all. Conſcience ſeemes on this manner to animate him; Feare not <hi>Paul</hi> the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this <hi>Tertullus,</hi> I witneſſe for thee thine Innocencie. I juſtifie it to the teeth of <hi>Tertullus,</hi> that he is one whoſe malice and covetouſneſſe hath made him ſet his conſcience to ſale; ſtand up therefore, and ſpeake boldly for thy ſelfe, dread them not. Well fare a good conſcience yet, that will ſpeake comfort to <hi>Paul,</hi> and make <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeake with courage, when none elſe dare be ſeene in his cauſe.</p>
                     <p>It was an ill caſe <hi>David</hi> was in, <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:262:73"/> 69. 20. 21. <hi>Reproach hath broken mine heart, and I am full of heavineſſe, and I looked for ſome to take pitty, but there was none, and for comforters, but I found none: they gave me alſo gall for my meat, and in my thirſt they gave mee vineger to drinke.</hi> A very hard caſe indeed. Where was now <hi>Davids</hi> familiar friend, his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with whom hee was wont to take ſweet counſell, what was become of him now? Poſſibly ſome of his acquaintance were at this time like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joynt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 19. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in an unfaithfull man is like a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken tooth, and a foot out of joynt</hi> Others it may be that had profeſt him loue, were ready to faſten a poyſoned tooth in him. This was <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, and this may be any mans caſe; but now at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a pinch appeares the excellency and benefit of a good Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Though all a mans friends ſhould prove <hi>Iobs</hi> friends, like the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brooks of <hi>Teman,</hi> that in winter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſwell the bankes, but in the ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat of Sommer prove drie ditches yet then, even then well fare a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. That will heale <hi>Davids</hi> heart broken with reproach, that will cheere
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:262:73"/> him up in his heavineſſe, that will ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the gall, and take away the ſharpenes of the vineger, which his enemies have given him to drinke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There is a generation,</hi> Prov. 30. 14. <hi>whoſe teeth are as ſwords, and their jaw teeth as knives;</hi> and <hi>Pro.</hi> 12. 18. that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration <hi>ſpeakes as the piercing of a ſword.</hi> There is a generation, whoſe <hi>words are wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds that go down into the innermoſt parts of the belly.</hi> Pro. 18. 8. Theſe be dangerous generations. But what generation are they? <hi>Generations of vipers.</hi> Pſal. 140. 3. <hi>Adders poyſon is under their lips. Iunius</hi> tranſlates it, <hi>Venenum ptyados,</hi> The poiſon of the <hi>ſpitting Serpent.</hi> They be then ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of ſpitting ſerpents, even of fiery ſerpents, that have their tongues ſet on fire from hell, and ſo they ſpit fiery poyſon in the faces of Innocents. Now there is no man can live in this world, at whom theſe adders will not ſpit, no man can be free from the ſprinckling of their poyſon. The diſciple is not above the maſter; If theſe ſnakes have hiſſed at the Lord of the houſe; and if theſe ſpitting Serpents have caſt their poiſon in his face, why would they feare to do it to the ſervants? But is there then no balme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:262:74"/> this poyſon? No buckler againſt theſe ſwords? Yes, there is the ſoveraigne balme, and the impenetrable buckler of a good conſcience. It is a balſome that will allay the poyſon of theſe Adders, that it ſhall never burſt a mans heart, or if theſe ſwords pierce the very innermoſt bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, yet this will ſo ſalve theſe wounds, that they ſhall not ranckle, nor become mortall? Oh! how mortall is this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders poyſon, how fatall are theſe ſwords, how keene their edge, and how full of paine their wounds, where inward guilt gives ſtrength unto them? But integrity and goodneſſe of conſcience, is a precious balme of <hi>Gilead,</hi> that takes away the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of this poyſon, &amp; the ſtinging ſmart of the wounds of theſe ſwords.</p>
                     <p>Let <hi>Paul</hi> live with ever ſo good a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience before God, and man, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 16. yet <hi>Tertullus</hi> will play the ſpitting ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and hee will ſpit, yea, ſpue forth his poyſon in his face, and in the face of an whole Court will not ſpare openly to ſlander him for an arrant varlet, a lewd, peſtilent, and a villanous fellow. Such drivel will the malicious world ſpit in the face of Godlineſſe. But mark now the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and comfort of a good conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:262:74"/> Either a good conſcience with <hi>Stephens</hi> Angelicall face will dazle, and ſhame the devils Oratours, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Having a good conſcience that they may be aſhamed,</hi> or elſe like <hi>Paul</hi> it can ſhake off thoſe vipers without ſwelling or falling downe dead. Yea, if Satans orators, will needs be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their mouthes againſt <hi>Paul;</hi> yet ſo good is his conſcience, that as <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> appealed from Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> to Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> namely, from him in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to him in his cold blood, and better adviſed, ſo dares <hi>Paul</hi> appeale from <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus</hi> to <hi>Tertullus, David</hi> from <hi>Shimei</hi> to <hi>Shimei,</hi> from enemies to enemies, from their tongues to their hearts, from their mouthes to their Conſciences, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their owne integritie to bee ſuch, as that their enemies owne hearts give their tongues the ly, and tels them that againſt their Conſcienſes poſſeſſed with meere malice they are hurried on in Satans ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. <hi>Tertullus</hi> knowes he lyes, and his owne Conſcience tells him hee lyes in his throate, that <hi>Paul</hi> is an honeſter man that himſelfe, yea, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is, that <hi>Pauls</hi> Conſcience com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts him, and aſſures him that <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> his Conſcience aſſures him all this,

But now at ſuch a pinch appeares the benefit of a good conſcience; Let ever ſo many riſe up falſly to witneſſe againſt him, yet his conſcience will witneſſe as faſt for him. <hi>My friends ſcorne mee,</hi> ſayes <hi>Iob, Iob</hi> 16. 20.

Every blaſt of ill newes, and tidings of feare, how full of terrible apprehenſions it fils an ill conſcience, it miſerably unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and diſtracts it, whilſt a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, what blaſts ſoever blow, hath its heart ſteddy and at good command.</p>
                     <p>Mee thinkes when I conſider <hi>Noah</hi> in his Cabbine, or neſt in the Arke, with
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:262:82"/> what ſecurity and quiet of heart hee ſits there, notwithſtanding the clattering of the raines upon the Arke, the roaring of the waters, and the hideous howling and out-cryes of thoſe that were drown'd in the flood, I ſee the Embleme of a good conſcience. <hi>Tubalcain,-Lamech, Iabal, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> with what horrid perplexities are their ſoules diſtraught. Some climbe up this houſe top, ſome this high tree, others flee to ſome high mountaine, and there in what horror and amazement are they, whilſt one ſees his Children ſprawling, another his wife ſtrugling for life upon the face of the mercileſſe waters, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially whilſt they behold the waters riſing by little and little, and purſuing them to the houſe tops, and threatning to ſweepe them off from the heads of the Mountaines, to which they had betaken themſelves. Theſe feares and amazements were worſe then an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth deathes.

Iuſt ſuch is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and happineſſe of a man with a good conſcience in ſad times. Whileſt the high hils, and mountaines are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the great and brave ſpirits of the world are overwhelmed with feare, are poſſeſt with dreadfull apprehenſions, ſo as they know not which way to looke, nor which way to take, even then a man with a good conſcience hath a ſtrange quiet of heart, is full of ſweet ſecurity and reſolution, and amids all the ſhrikes, howlings, and wringing of hands of earthly men, by patience poſſeſſes his ſoule, is maſter of himſelfe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes his ſoule to reſt. His Arke is pitcht within and without. The peace of God, and the peace of a good conſcience, keepes the water-floods from comming
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:262:84"/> into his ſoule. The raine and the waves they beat upon the Arke, but yet they pierced it not. A man with a good con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience may fall into, and may be ſwept away with common calamites: yet how ever it fare with his outward man, yet his ſoule is free from that horrour; and thoſe madding perplexities wherewithall wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ones are overtaken. The peace of a good conſcience ſhall keepe off theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting feares from his minde Though he cannot be free happily from the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon deſtructions,</hi> yet ſhall be free from the <hi>common diſtractions</hi> of the world. There be two things in common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>The ſword without, and terror within, Deut.</hi> 32. 25. and the latter of the two, is the worſe by far. Now here is the benefit of a good conſcience, though it doth not ſave alwaies from the <hi>ſword without,</hi> yet it delivers alwaies from the <hi>terror within;</hi> which gives a terrible edge to the ſword, and which being removed the ſword is nothing ſo terrible. When the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites were deſtroyed by Iſrael, there was a double ſorrow and ſmart upon them. The ſword of the Iſraelite, and Gods <hi>Hornet, Ioſh.</hi> 24. 12. What was that <hi>Hornet?</hi> Nothing elſe but that diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:262:85"/> and perplexing feare and terrour wherewith God filled their hearts, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 27, 28. There is no <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> can ſo vex with his ſting, as theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors vex evill conſciences in evill dayes. Now here is the priviledge of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, though they may ſmart with the ſword, yet the <hi>Hornet</hi> ſhal not ſting them, nor fill their hearts with that throbbing anguiſh, that theſe terrors in times of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie put evill conſciences to.</p>
                     <p>A ſweet motive to make any in love with a good conſcience. Whileſt we look upon the evills of the times, wee cannot but looke for euill times. Looke we upon our ſinnes, and Gods adminiſtration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; upon the malice and policies of the adverſaries of Gods grace, and what doe theſe but prognoſticate heavy things. Now ſuppoſe a flood ſhould come, would we not be glad of an arke, and ſuch a cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin therein, as ſhould keepe out the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from our ſoules? Get then the pitch of a good Conſcience, and thou ſhalt fit like <hi>Noah,</hi> if not free from the waters, yet free from the feares of <hi>Lamech,</hi> and <hi>Tubal-cain,</hi> which are worſe than the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For the feares of ſuch evills are more bitter and inſufferable than the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:262:85"/> themſelves. Suppoſe, I ſay, a flood ſhould come, who would not give a kingdome for an Arke well pitcht? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe calamitie ſhould come, who would not give a world for a good Conſcience then? <hi>Iabel, Gen.</hi> 4. 20. he is buſie in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of tents, and he is among his flockes and cattell; and <hi>Iubal, Geneſ.</hi> 4. 21. hee is wholly upon his merry pins, as his Harpe and Organs; He and his take <hi>the Timbrel and the Harpe, and rejoyce at the ſound of the Organ, Iob</hi> 21. 12. And theſe jolly jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall lads give poore <hi>Noah</hi> many a drie flout, many a ſcornfull ſcoffe, whileſt hee is building his Arke, and aske what this brainſicke &amp; mad fellow meanes to make ſuch a veſſell, whether he meant to ſayle on the dry land, or to make a ſea when he had made his ſhip? I, but when the flood is come, and the waters begin to bee chin deepe, then aske <hi>Iabel</hi> whether building of tents, or building of an Arke bee the wiſer worke? then whether is better <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, or <hi>Iubals</hi> Pipes? Now that the flood is come, &amp; theſe come perhaps wading middle deep to the Arke ſide, and bellow and howle to <hi>Noah</hi> to open the arke to them: Now would not <hi>Iabel</hi> give all his tents, and all his cattell, but to bee
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:262:86"/> where <hi>Noahs</hi> dog lyes? would not <hi>Iubal</hi> now give all his pipes and merriment, to have but the place that an hogge had in the Arke. Now <hi>Iubal,</hi> let us heare one of your merry ſongs, pipe now and make your ſelves merry with gybing at <hi>Noahs</hi> folly, in making a ſhip to ſaile on dry land. What aileſt thou <hi>Iubal</hi> to howle &amp; wring thine hands thus? where is thine Harpe &amp; Organs now? cheere up thy ſoule now with theſe vanities. Now the Flood is come, now <hi>Noah</hi> is in the Arke, now Sirs, you that are ſuch <hi>men of renowne, Gen.</hi> 6. 4. you that were the brave gallants of the earth, now tell me who is the foole, and who is the wiſe man now?</p>
                     <p>How many in the dayes of peace make light of a good Conſcience; yea if they ſee others to be but carefull in rigging of their Ship, and pitching, and trimming up ſuch an Arke, how ready are they to ſpend their byting ſcoffes, and their tart jeſts upon them, but if ever times of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; calamitie, and a fire flood of Gods wrath, <hi>Nah.</hi> 1. 6, 8. ſhould breake in, then would a good Conſcience hold up the head with much comfort, and reſolution, whileſt thoſe that formerly made a jeaſt of a good conſcience ſhould have aking,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:262:86"/> and quaking hearts, by reaſon of thoſe unmeaſurable feares that ſhall ſeize upon them. A good conſcience will make a man muſick; when <hi>Iubal</hi> ſhalbe glad not only to put up, but with indignation and anguiſh of heart to throw away and curſe his pipes. Well fare a good conſcience in evill dayes. Pitch and trim up this Ark, there is no ſuch proviſion againſt evill dayes, as is a good conſcience. It will do a man ſervice, and ſupport him, when all the brave ſpirits of the earth ſhalbe blank, and at their wits end.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, the benefit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <note place="margin">3. <hi>The comfort of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in time of Sickneſſe.</hi>
                        </note> of a good conſcience, is conſpicuous in the time of ſickneſſe, or a mans private and perſonall croſſes in his eſtate, &amp;c. A ſicke man with an hayle conſcience, is a cheary and a comfortable man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtaine his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity;</hi> that is, the ſpirit it ſelfe being hayle, and ſound, it wil enable him to bear any bodily ſickneſſe. <hi>But a wounded ſpirit who can beare;</hi> yea a wounded or a ſicke body, who can comfortably beare, if the ſpirit or conſcience be ſicke? But let the conſcience bee good and ſound; and it helpes a man with great eaſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to beare the ſickneſſe of the body. It
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:262:87"/> is a ſhrewd burthen to beare two ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at once, to have a ſicke body, and a ſicke conſcience. A man ſhall find enough of the eaſieſt of them ſingle and alone. But yet an hayle conſcience in an infirme bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſweetly helpes our infirmitie. Let a man have ever ſo hayle and heathfull a body, yet if the conſcience be naught, and withall awakened, fals to galling and griping, he ſhall find but little joy in his bodily health; ſo contrarily, let a mans conſcience be good; and though his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be ſicke and weake, yet it is a great deale of ſweet refreſhment that it ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Sickneſſe in it ſelfe is exceeding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, and in the time of ſickneſſe commonly all bodily comforts, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of meates, drinkes and ſleepe, faile; yea but then here is the benefit of a good conſcience, that will not then fayle, but as it is ſaid, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10. 9. <hi>Money anſwers all things,</hi> ſo a good conſcience anſwers all things, the comfort of it ſupplies the wants of all other comforts. When in ſickneſſe the comfort of meat, drink, and ſleepe is gone, they are all found againe in the comfort of a good conſcience; that will be meat, and drinke, that will be reſt
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:262:87"/> and ſleep, that will make a mans ſick-bed ſoft, and eaſie, that ſhall be as the Angels were to Chriſt in his hunger in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, <hi>they miniſtred unto him,</hi> and ſo will a good conſcience miniſter comfort in the want of all other comforts, ſo that a man may ſay of a good conſcience, as we uſe to ſay of ſome ſolid, ſubſtantiall diſh, that there are Partridge, Pheſants and Quailes in it; ſo though outward comforts ceaſe their office, and their worke be ſuſpended, yet a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence comes in its roome, and in it are meat, drinke, ſleepe, eaſe, refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what not? A good conſcience is an Electuary, or a Cordiall that hath all theſe ingredients in it. There is no ſuch Cordiall to a ſicke man, as the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall of a good conſcience. All Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to this Phyſician are but ſuch Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as <hi>Iobs</hi> friends, <hi>Iob</hi> 13. 4. <hi>Yea are Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians of no value.</hi> A motive of great weight to make men in love with a good conſcience. Who can be free from ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and how tedious and weariſome a time is the time of ſickneſſe? Now who would not make much of a Cordiall that might cheare him then, of a receipt that might feed him then? As then we would
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:262:88"/> bee glad of a chearfull and comfortable ſpirit upon our ſicke beds, ſo make much of a good conſcience. Whence is it that moſt men in their ſickneſſes have ſuch drooping ſpirits, lye groaning altogether under their bodily paines, or lye ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſenſleſly, no ſenſe of any thing but paine and ſickneſſe? Meerely from the want of a good conſcience, they have laid up no Cordial, no comfortable Electuary for themſelves in their health time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of ſickneſſe. Indeed you ſhall have the miſerable comforters of the world on this manner cheering them; why, how now man, where is your heart? Plucke up a good heart man, never feare for a little ſicknes, &amp;c. True indeed, they ſhould not need to feare, if they could plucke up a good heart. But they that will plucke it up when they are ſicke, muſt lay it up when they are well. Hee that hath a good conſcience to get when he lyes upon his ſicke bed, is like a man that hath his <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> to buy when hee is fallen into a ſwoune; A wiſe man that feares ſwouning, would have his hot-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-bottle hanging alwayes ready at his beds-head. But as in other croſſes by ſickneſſe and the like, ſo is the comfort
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:262:88"/> of a good conſcience, never more ſweet, then when a man is under the croſſe for conſcience ſake, and ſuffers affliction and vexation to keepe a good conſcience. Then above all other times will conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doe the office of a Comforter, and will ſtand to him that will ſtand for it. When <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> heares his Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace ſeaven times hotter than at other times, then a good conſcience will ſpeak comfort ſeven times ſweeter than at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times.</p>

There is no one thought ſo terrible to ſuch an one, as the thought of death, nothing that hee more wiſhes to avoid. Oh, how loath, and unwilling is ſuch an one to dye.</p>
                     <p>But come now to a man that hath lived as <hi>Paul</hi> did in all good conſcience, and how is it with him upon his death-bed? His end is peace; ſo full of joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; ſo is hee raviſhed with the inward and unſpeakable conſolations of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that it is no wonder at all that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> ſhould wiſh to dye the death of the righteous, the death of a man with a good conſcience.</p>
                     <p>The day of a mens mariage, <hi>is the day of the joy</hi> of a mans <hi>heart, Can.</hi> 3. 11. and the day of mariage is not ſo joyfull a day, as is the day of death to a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. There are but few that can marry with that joy wherewith a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence dies.</p>
                     <p>It enables a man not onely to looke <hi>Ananias</hi> and the Councel in the face,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:262:91"/> but even to look death it ſelfe in the face, without thoſe amazing terrours, yea, it makes the face of death ſeeme lovely, and amiable. Hee whoſe conſcience is good, and ſees the face of God reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him in Chriſt, hee can ſay as <hi>Iacob</hi> did when he ſaw the face of <hi>Ioſeph, Gen.</hi> 46. 30. <hi>Now let me dye, ſince I have ſeene thy face.</hi> It is the priviledge of a good conſcience alone, to goe to the grave, as <hi>Agag</hi> did to <hi>Samuel,</hi> and to ſay that truly, which he ſpake beſides the booke, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 32. <hi>Hee came pleaſantly, and hee ſaid, Surely the bitterneſſe of death is paſt.</hi> Hee was deceived, and therefore had no ſuch cauſe to be ſo pleaſant, but a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience can, yea, cannot chuſe but be ſo pleaſant, even when going out of the world, becauſe the guilt of ſinne being waſhed away in Chriſts blood; it knowes that the bitterneſſe of death is paſt, and the ſweetneſſe of life eternall is at hand.</p>
                     <p>A man whoſe debts are paid, he dares goe out of doores, dare meet and face the Sergeants, and the conſcience purged by the blood of Chriſt, can look as undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly on the face of death. He that hath forgotten the ſting, that is, the guilt of conſcience, taken away by faith in Chriſt,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:262:92"/> he lookes not upon death as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> upon the fiery Serpents, but lookes upon it as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>O death where is thy ſting?</hi> Who feares a Bee, an Hornet, a Snake, or a Serpent, when they have loſt their ſting. The guilt of ſinne is the ſting of conſcience, its the ſting of death that ſtings the conſcience. <hi>The ſting of death is ſinne,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Plucke then ſin out of the conſcience, and at once the conſcience is made good, and death made weake, and diſarmed of his weapon. And when the conſcience ſees death unſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſarmed, it is freed of feare, and even in the very act of death, can joyfully triumph over death, oh Death where is thy ſting?</p>
                     <p>A good conſcience lookes upon death, as upon the Sheriffe that comes to give him poſſeſſion of his Inheritance, or as <hi>Lazarus</hi> upon the Angels that came to carry his ſoule into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, and therfore can welcome death, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine him joyfully. And whereas an ill conſcience makes a man ſee death as if he ſaw the Devill, a good conſcience makes a man ſee the face of death, as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaw <hi>Eſau's</hi> face, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. <hi>I have ſeene thy face, as the face of God;</hi> they ſee the face of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:262:92"/> death with unſpeakeable joy, raviſhment of heart, and exultation of ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Well now, what a motive have wee here, to make us labour for good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Even <hi>Balaam</hi> himſelfe would faine make a good end, and die in peace: and who wiſhes not his death-bed may be a mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> from whence he may ſee the heavenly <hi>Canaan?</hi> Lo here, <hi>Balaam,</hi> the way to dye the death of the righteous, <hi>I have lived in all good conſcience untill this day.</hi> They that have conſcience in their life, ſhal have comfort at their death; they that live conſcionably, they ſhal dy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably; they that live in all good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence till their dying day, ſhall depart in the abundance of comfort at their dying day.</p>
                     <p>There will come a day wherein wee muſt lay downe theſe Tabernacles, the day of death will aſſuredly come. How lamentable a thing will it then be, to be ſo deſtitute, and deſolate of all comfort, as to be driven to that extremity, as to curſe our birth day? oh! what would Comfort be worth at our laſt houre, at our laſt gaſpe, whilſt our deareſt friends, ſhall be weeping, wringing their hands and lamenting; then, then what would
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:262:93"/> inward comfort be worth? Who would not hold the whole world an eaſie price for it then? Well then, would wee then have Comfort and Ioy, oh then get a good conſcience now, which will yield comfort, when all other comforts ſhall utterly faile, and ſhall be life in the middſt of death. How happy is that man, that when the ſentence of death is paſſed upon him, can ſay with <hi>Hezekiah, Iſ.</hi> 38. 3. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member now O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi> Indeed the text ſayes, that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> wept ſore, but yet, not as fearing death, for hee could not feare death, who had thus feared God, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the promiſe was not yet made good to him in a Son and Heire of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; hence came thoſe teares. It is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe an unſpeakable joy, that ſuch a conſcience as <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> was, will ſpeake to a man upon his death-bed.</p>
                     <p>Every one profeſſes a deſire to make a good end: Here is the way to make good that deſire, to live in all good conſcience. Alas how pittifull, and miſerable a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition live moſt men in; All the dayes of their life and health, they have no regard
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:262:93"/> of a good conſcience. Notwithſtanding that men are preſſed continually to this one care, by the inſtancie and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of Gods Miniſters, yet how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably is it neglected? Well, at laſt the day of death comes, and then what would not they give for a comfortable end? If the gold of Ophir would purchaſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, it ſhould flie then. Then poaſt for this Miniſter, and run for the other, as in the ſweating ſickneſſe in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, then for Gods ſake but one word of comfort, then O bleſſed men of God, one word of peace. Now alas what would you have them to doe? Are they or your own courſes in fault, that you want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at your death? What would you have us doe? Wee muſt referre you to your owne conſciences, we cannot make oyle of flint, nor cruſh ſweet wine out of ſowre Grapes, we dare not flatter you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences. If you would give us a world, we cannot comfort you when your owne conſciences witneſſe againſt you, that ſuch comforts belong not to you. Doe not idely in this caſe hope for comfort from Miniſters, be it knowne unto you, you muſt have it from your owne conſciences. Many on their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:262:94"/> cry to the Miniſter, as ſhe did to the King, 2 <hi>King</hi> 6. 26, 27. <hi>Helpe my Lord O King.</hi> But marke what hee anſwers, <hi>If the Lord doe not helpe thee, whence ſhall I helpe thee, out of the barne floore, or out of the Wine preſſe?</hi> So muſt wee anſwer to ſuch as cry, Helpe, helpe, O man of God: If God and your owne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces helpe you not, whence ſhall we help you? If there had beene Corne within the barnes, the King could eaſily have helped her, but he could not make corne: So if men have carryed any thing into their conſciences, if they themſelves have inned any proviſion and comfort, by being conſcionable in their lives, then we can helpe and comfort them, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe doe not thinke that we can make comforts, and make good conſciences upon your death-beds. If your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences can ſay for you, that you have beene carefull in your life time to know God, to walke holily and religiouſly before him, &amp;c. then wee dare be bold to comfort and cheere you, then dare wee ſpeake peace confidently to you. But if your conſciences accuſe you of your ignorance, your oathes, Sabbath-breaches, worldlineſſe, rebellion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:262:94"/> oppreſſion, drunkenneſſe, &amp;c. and finally, impenitencie: What is it you would have us to doe? What can wee ſay, but as the Prophet to <hi>Zedekiah, Ier.</hi> 37. 19. <hi>Where</hi> are now <hi>your Prophets that propheſied unto you, ſaying, the King of Babylon ſhall not come againſt you?</hi> So, where be thoſe that in your life time told you, ye need not to be ſo careful and preciſe to keep good conſciences, leſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do will ſerve the turne, <hi>now</hi> what think ye of them? <hi>now</hi> what peace have you in thoſe wayes, what comfort can theſe give you <hi>now?</hi> Or elſe what can we ſay when men in anguiſh of conſcience lye toſſing upon their beds, but what <hi>Reuben</hi> ſaid to his brethren when they were in diſtreſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 21, 22. <hi>Did not I warne you, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sin not, &amp;c.</hi> So muſt wee, what doe ye call to us for comfort? did not wee warne you many a time and oft, ſaying, Sinne not, nor live in thoſe dangerous courſes? Did not wee warne you? Oh to have our conſciences and Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters thus to grate upon us, what an uncomfortable condition will this be? Would wee then prevent ſuch ſorrow, and be cheerfull, and cheered at our latter ends? lay up a good conſcience,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:262:95"/> then, lay in ſomewhat for conſcience, and Gods Miniſters to worke upon, and from which they both may be able to raiſe comfort to you. Get a good conſcience, and live in it all thy dayes, and then though thou ſhouldeſt want the benefit of a comforting Miniſter, yet thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall doe the office of a comforting Miniſter, and ſhall be the ſame unto thee that the Angel was unto Chriſt in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 43. and ſhall miniſter ſuch comfort unto thee, as ſhall make thee ready to leap into the grave for joy. This ſhall be as another <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſtaffe for thee to leane &amp; reſt upon, when thou ſhalt be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy death-bed. If men knew but the worth of a good conſcience at the houre of death, wee ſhould need no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to worke mens hearts to be in love therewith.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly and laſtly, the benefit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <note place="margin">5. <hi>The comfort of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience at the day of Iudgment.</hi>
                        </note> of a good conſcience is great at the day of judgement. Oh the ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and confidence of heart that a good conſcience will yield unto a man at that day. What will become of all the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantean ſpirits, and the brave fellowes of the earth then? Alas for their yellings, and curſing of themſelves, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions!
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:262:95"/> what howling and crying to the mountaines, as they did, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. <hi>Hide</hi> us, <hi>Cover</hi> us, yea, daſh and quaſh us in a thouſand pieces. When an ill conſcience is awakened, it is not to be imagined how ſmall a thing will gaſtre it. <hi>The ſound of a ſhaken leafe ſhall chaſe them, and they ſhall fly, as flying from a ſword, and they ſhall fall when none purſues, Levit.</hi> 26. 36. <hi>A dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſound is in his eares, Iob.</hi> 15. 21. Hee heares nothing, but he thinkes he heares alwaies ſome terrible and dreadfull noiſe. And then if a ſhaken leafe ſhall chaſe, and ſhall put them into a ſhaking feare, what caſe will ſuch be in, when as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes <hi>Iob</hi> 26. 11. <hi>The pillars of heaven ſhall trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and when <hi>the powers of heaven ſhall be ſhaken, Luke</hi> 21. 26. When the heavens ſhall ſhake and flame above them, when the earth ſhall quake, and tremble under them, what caſe will they be in then? If meere imaginations fill their eares with <hi>dreadfull ſounds</hi> where there is no ſound at all: Oh what a dreadfull ſound ſhall be in their eares when the <hi>Sea ſhall roare, Luk</hi> 21. 25. when <hi>the laſt trumpe ſhall ſound,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. when they ſhall heare the <hi>ſhout and voyce of an Angel,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 16. what dreadfull ſounds will theſe be in the eares
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:262:96"/> of ill conſciences? How will theſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſounds confound their ſoules with horrour and amazement.</p>
                     <p>But now for a good conſcience, how is it with it then? Even amiddſt all theſe dreadfull ſounds it <hi>lookes up,</hi> and <hi>lifts up the head, Luke</hi> 21. 28. and enables a man with a cheery confidence <hi>to ſtand before the Son of man, Luke</hi> 21. 36.</p>
                     <p>The Malefactor who looks for the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how dreadful is the Iudges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the Aſſiſes, attended with the troopes of halberds, in his eye; but the priſoner that knowes his owne innocencie, and that he ſhall be quit &amp; diſcharged, his heart leaps at the Iudges approach, how terrible ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he come atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to the bench, it glads his heart to ſee that day, which ſhalbe the day of his liberty &amp; releaſe. <hi>An hypocrite ſhall not come before him, Ioh.</hi> 13. 16. much leſſe, ſhal <hi>look up,</hi> &amp; <hi>lift up his head,</hi> or <hi>ſtand before him, Pſ.</hi> 1. 5.

                     <p>It will be with good and evill conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in that day, as it was with <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Butler, and Baker, on <hi>Pharaohs</hi> birth-day.

                     <p>Such will the apparition of Chriſt unto judgement be, unto good and evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, as was the apparition of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>There was a great earthquake, for the Angel of the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaven, his countenance was like lightening, and his rayment white as ſnow.</hi> Here was a terrible ſight, but yet not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like terrible to all the beholders.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a feaſt.</hi> The excellencie of a good conſcience is ſet forth by the ſame <note place="margin">Quo enim melius epu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantur ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi quam bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis factis? aut quid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liud tam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile poteſt explere ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorum men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni operis co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But why a <hi>feaſt?</hi> A feaſt for three regards.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the <hi>ſelfe ſufficiencie,</hi> and ſweet <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> and <hi>contentment</hi> that a good conſcience hath within it ſelfe. Feaſting and faſting are oppoſite. In faſting upon the want of food there is an emptineſſe and a griping hunger, which makes the body inſatiably to crave. But at a feaſt there is abundance, and variety of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes and dainties, ready at hand to ſatisfie a mans appetite to the full, he can have a mind to nothing but it is before him. The very beſt of every thing that is to be had is at a feaſt. <hi>A feaſt of fat things, Iſa.</hi> 25. 6. <hi>of fat things full of marrow.</hi> Such is the ſufficencie of ſatisfaction, the abundance
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:262:98"/> of ſweetneſſe, and contentment that is to be found in a good conſcience. It is a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble richly furniſht with all varieties, and dainties. There is no pleaſure, comfort, or contentment that a mans heart can wiſh, but it may be abundantly had in a good conſcience; as at a feaſt there is a collection of all the dainties and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies that ſea and land can afford.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the <hi>mirth</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> of it. <hi>A feaſt is made for laughter, Eccl.</hi> 10. 19. At a feaſt there is mirth, muſick, and delight in the comfortable uſe of the creatures. Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, penſiveneſſe, and ſorrow, theſe are baniſht from the houſe of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. Faſting and feaſting are oppoſite, in faſting indeed there is weeping, mourning and ſorrowing; but in a feaſt contrarily, there is mirth, merriment and joy.</p>
                     <p>There were under the Law appointed ſolemn holy feaſts anniverſarily to be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, and at thoſe ſolemn feaſts were the ſilver trumpets ſounded, <hi>Num.</hi> 10. 10. and the ſound of the trumpets was a <hi>joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſound, Pſ.</hi> 89. 15.

                        <hi>ſhalt obſerve the feaſt of Tabernacles ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes, &amp;c. And thou ſhalt</hi> rejoyce <hi>in the</hi> feaſt, <hi>&amp;c.

They kept them dayes of <hi>gladneſſe and feaſting, of feaſting and joy.</hi> Even ſuch is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of a good conſcience. All the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment and muſick, wine and good chear, will not make a mans heart ſo light and ſo merry, as the wine which is drunke at the feaſt of a good conſcience will doe. This takes away all heavineſſe and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit, and hath the like effects with naturall wine. It makes a man <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get</hi> his ſpiritual <hi>poverty, and remember that miſery no more, Pro.</hi> 31. 7. Nay, as wine not only takes away ſadnes, but withal brings a naturall gladneſſe with it, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 104. 15. <hi>Wine that makes glad the heart of man:</hi> ſo doth this wine at this feaſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 11, 12. <hi>Light is ſowne for the righteous, and gladneſſe for the upright in heart, Rejoyce in the Lord ye righteous.</hi> None ſo glad an heart, as the upright in heart.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:262:99"/> a mans heart, but makes a man as not able to containe, even to ſhout for joy, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 32. 11. <hi>Shout for joy all ye that are upright in heart,</hi> yea <hi>ſhout aloud for joy, Pſal.</hi> 132. 16. That look as it is ſaid of the Lord, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 78. 65. <hi>The Lord awaked like a mighty man that ſhouts by reaſon of wine.</hi> So ſuch is the plenty, abundance, ſweetneſſe, and ſtrength of the wine of this feaſt, that it makes men in a holy jollity, even to break forth into ſhouting, and ſinging. This wine being liberally drunken, wherein there is no exceſſe, fils a mans heart with ſuch an overflowing exuberancie of joy, as hee cannot hold, but hee muſt needs ſhew it in Pſalmes, Hymnes and ſpirituall ſongs; and hence it is that <hi>the righteous do ſing and rejoyce, Pro.</hi> 29. 6. So that what joy a feaſt can yield, that can a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience yield much more, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>This is our</hi> rejoycing, <hi>the teſtimonie of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> Yea and that joy commanded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. at the feaſt of Tabernacles what was it but a Type of that ſpirituall joy, that the faithful under Chriſt ſhould have in keeping the feaſt of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? The feaſt of a good conſcience is the true feaſt of Tabernacles, in which as in the other, there ſhall need no charge
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:262:99"/> to rejoyce, and be merry, this feaſt will put ſuch ſpirit and life into a man, as ſhall make him ſing, skip, and ſhout for joy.</p>
                     <p>The feaſt of a good conſcience is not like a funerall feaſt, where mirth and joy are unſeemely, and unſeaſonable gueſts, there are heavie hearts and lookes, teares, and mourning, (which by the way how well they ſuit with feaſting let the world judge) but the feaſt of a good conſcience is a nuptiall feaſt, a marriage feaſt, and the day of marriage is <hi>the day of the joy of a mans heart, Cant.</hi> 3. 11. Such a feaſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a joyfull marriage feaſt doth a good conſcience make.</p>
                     <p>Oftentimes theſe bodily feaſts are but heavie feaſts, many for all their good cheere, company, and muſicke, cannot put away the heavineſſe of their hearts, but even in their feaſt are ſad hearted, and <hi>Sampſons</hi> wife <hi>wept</hi> all the dayes of the feaſt, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 14. 17. yea though a marriage feaſt. But in this feaſt of a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience here is no ſorrow, heavineſſe, or ſad me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, but all joy and gladneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For the <hi>ſociety</hi> and <hi>company.</hi> A feaſt is a collection, and a convention of many good friends together, whoſe ſociety and friendſhip is ſweet each to other. There
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:262:100"/> is no feaſt can afford the like company that a good conſcience hath. <hi>Woe to him that is alone, Ecc.</hi> 4. that is the wofull and ſolitary condition of evill conſciences. But a good conſcience hath ever good company, <hi>is not alone,</hi> for the Father is with it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 23. yea, the Son is with it: and Chriſt, and the man with a good conſcience, they <hi>ſup,</hi> and <hi>feaſt</hi> together, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 20. yea, and the ſpirit is with it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. <hi>The Communion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you.</hi> What feaſt in the world can ſhew ſuch company? And good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is the chiefe thing in a feaſt. Thus a good conſcience is a feaſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is <hi>better</hi> than a feaſt. And that in three regards.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In regard of the <hi>continuance</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity</hi> of it, <hi>A continuall feaſt. Nabal</hi> made a feaſt, a feaſt like a King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. but that feaſt laſted but one day. <hi>Sampſon</hi> at his marriage had a feaſt that laſted ſeven daies, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 14. 17. but yet that feaſt had an end. <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> his feaſt was the longeſt feaſt that ever we read of, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Hee made a feaſt many dayes, an hundred and fourſcore daies.</hi> But yet <hi>v.</hi> 5. it is ſaid, <hi>And when thoſe dayes were expired.</hi> So this long feaſt had an end. It was continued for
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:262:100"/> many dayes, but yet no continuall feaſt, it had an end. The feaſt of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not like an <hi>Vniverſity</hi> Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment feaſt. Great exceedings, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary good cheere and company for one night, but the next morrow to their bare Commons againe. Not like the <hi>feaſt</hi> of the <hi>Nativity,</hi> at which time there is great feaſting, and great cheere every where for twelve dayes, but when thoſe dayes are over, many a man is glad of bread and cheeſe, glad to skip at a cruſt. But this is a continuall feaſt all the yeare long, all a mans life long. Therfore 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>Rejoyce evermore,</hi> keep open houſe, and feaſting all the yeare long. The joy of a good conſcience was figured by the joy at the feaſt of Tabernacles. That feaſt laſted ſeven dayes. The joy muſt bee as long. Seven the number of perfection, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted the whole courſe of a mans life, and ſo their ſeven dayes joy, the <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all joy</hi> and jollity of this <hi>continuall feaſt</hi> of a good conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Conſcience and a wife, as they agree in many things, be they good, be they ill, ſo in this alſo. If the conſcience be evill, it is like an <hi>evill wife,</hi> and ſhe a <hi>continuall evill, Prov.</hi> 27. 15. <hi>A continuall dropping in a</hi>

A ſhrewiſh waſpiſh wife, is a continuall vexation and diſquiet. Such is an evill conſcience, a continuall ſorrow. Contrarily, a good conſcience is like a <hi>good wife,</hi> a good wife is <hi>a continuall comfort,</hi> a comfort in health, in ſickneſſe, in peace, in diſtreſſe, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31. 12. <hi>She doth him good and not evill</hi> all the dayes <hi>of her life.</hi> Not ſome good, and a great deale of evill withall, but all good, good &amp; not evill. Not good at ſometime, and none at other times, <hi>but all the daies of her life,</hi> ſhe is a continuall comfort. So is the comfort of a good conſcience. It keepes holy-day and feaſting every day. It is all feaſt; a feaſt for ever; there is no <hi>Lent,</hi> or <hi>faſting</hi> dayes that interrupt this feaſt. This is the peculiar privilege of this feaſt to be continuall; belly feaſting can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo: for 1. A man cannot alwayes feaſt though he would, a mans revenues would bee exhauſt, his expences would ſoone ſink his eſtate. Continuall feaſting would ſoone begger and undoe a man of good eſtate, <hi>Pro.</hi> 21. 17. <hi>Hee that loves Wine and Oyle ſhall not be rich.</hi> It is not ſo here; the revenue of a good conſcience is
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:262:101"/> bottomleſſe, it cannot be ſpent, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is able to keepe a rich and a full furniſht Table all the yeare long. Here is a myſterie in this feaſt, the larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences to day, the more laid in to keepe the feaſt the better to morrow; a man growes rich by feaſting.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Suppoſe a man might be able to feaſt alwayes, or might feed at another mans <note place="margin">Voluptas tune cum maxime de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectat extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guitur. Nec multum loci habet; iat<expan>

At this continual feaſt, heere is a continuall freſh appetite, and freſh delights; here is continuall feaſting without loathing and ſatiety.</p>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:262:102"/> conſcience, hath a feaſt, though he have nothing elſe but it. A good conſcience, though it have nothing but browne bread and water, yet this hard fare marres not the feaſt; For this feaſt <hi>ſtands not in meates, and drinks, but in righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 14. 17. <hi>Quietneſſe and a dry morſell is better then an houſefull of good cheare with ſtrife, Pro.</hi> 17. 1.

But when there is inward quietneſſe of a good conſcience, and a mans heart is at quiet from his peace with his God, what excellent cheere is a <hi>dry morſel,</hi> then? Though a man have ever ſo good fare, yet to have it ſawced with the bitterneſſe of contention, and to live in a continuall wrangling with peviſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, what poore content would a well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht Table afford ſuch a man? And what poore cheere, eſpecially, would all theſe feaſts in the world make, where there is brawling and contention from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? Here then is the excellencie of this feaſt above all other feaſts. This feaſt
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:262:103"/> is able to ſubſiſt, and to maintaine it ſelfe without other feaſting; other feaſting is nothing without this of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

A good conſcience is it that ſweetens and ſeaſons all the diſhes of a feaſt, that is the ſawce that makes meat ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury, the ſugar that ſweetens Wine,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:262:103"/> that is the muſicke that makes a mans heart dance.</p>
                     <p>But let a man goe to the moſt ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and delicious feaſts without a good conſcience, and how is it with him then?

Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience deales with them, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were dealt withal in their quaile feaſt. They had their Quailes, and their
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:262:104"/> dainties, but a man would rather want their good cheere, than have their ſawce. Their ſweet meat had ſharpe ſawce. Whilſt the fleſh was between their teeth, Gods anger brake in upon them. So whilſt many are chewing their dainties, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence fils their mouth with gravell, and ſo ſawces and ſpices their diſhes, that they find but little content therein. So miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are all feaſts and merriments of this world, when a man wants the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent feaſt of a good conſcience. So happy alſo are they that have the feaſt of a good conſcience, although they never taſte bit of other feaſt whilſt they live, although they be denied the crums that fall under the feaſting Gluttons table.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is better in regard of the <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality</hi> of it. As for belly feaſts, it ſtands not with every mans condition and purſe, to make them. It belongs onely to the richer and abler ſort to feaſt. Feaſting is a matter of charge and coſt, and ſo is out of the reach of the poorer ſort. But here is the excellencie of this feaſt. The pooreſt that is may make it, and the poore have as good priviledge to make it as the rich, and the poore in this reſpect may keepe as good an houſe as the beſt Nobleman,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:262:104"/> yea, for the moſt part the poorer ſort keep this feaſt beſt. <hi>Nabal</hi> makes <hi>a feaſt like a king,</hi> but wretched man, in the mean time what feaſt keepes his conſcience? It may be many a poore Carmelite neighbour of his that went in a poore ruſſet coat, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a poore thatcht cottage, kept that feaſt abundantly &amp; richly, whilſt he poore ſot had not the crums that fell from their tables. <hi>Lazarus</hi> could not have the crums that fell from the gluttons table, but how happy had it been with the glutton if in ſtead of this delicious fare he might have had but the reverſions of <hi>Lazarus</hi> boord. <hi>Lazarus</hi> may not come to his feaſt, no nor yet to his fragments, neither will <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> condition permit him to feaſt it as the glutton did, but yet this feaſt of a good conſcience, <hi>Lazarus</hi> may make as well as hee, and can, and doth keepe it, whilſt the glutton feeles many an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-biting gripe. What an excellent feaſt is this above all other feaſts, wherein the ruſſet hath as much priviledge as the vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, the beggar as the King, the poore tenant, as the rich Landlord? The rich Landlord often ſo feeds upon, and eates up his poor tenant by oppreſſion, that the tenant is kept low enough for feaſting;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:262:105"/> It is well with him if hee have food, hee had not need thinke of feaſting. But loe now the excellent feaſt of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: here may the Tenant keep as good cheere as the Landlord, yea, and it may be may feaſt, whilſt the rich Landlord is ready to ſtarve for want of this proviſion.</p>
                     <p>Now then all this conſidered, what a <hi>Motive</hi> ſhould it be to make us in love with a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience. How powerfully ſhould this perſwade us therto? whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God would perſwade men to come to the joyes of heaven, hee uſes no other argument than this, to invite them to a feaſt, as in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. Behold, here is the ſame argument, to move you to be in love with a good conſcience, behold the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites you to <hi>a feaſt,</hi> and to a feaſt where ye ſhall have ſufficiencie, without want, or loathing, where ye ſhal have wine, mirth, muſick, and good Company, to the full. The twelve dayes feaſt of the <hi>Nativitie,</hi> how is it longed for before hand, &amp; how welcommed when it is come? And what may the reaſon be? But only becauſe it is a feaſting time. This is counted a bleſſed good time: and why a bleſſed good time? As Chriſt was a bleſſed good man, &amp; the prophet that ſhould come into the world,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:262:105"/> and therefore ſhould be made a King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee had fed and filled their bellies, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. So the moſt make that a bleſſed time, not for the memorial of Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but becauſe of the loaves Chriſt ſhall be a King, &amp; becauſe of the feaſt, the time is bleſſed. Well then, &amp; is the world ſo deſirous, and ſo glad of feaſting? Are feaſting times ſuch bleſſed times? Lo then I invite you to a feaſt, to a bleſſed good feaſt indeed, that will make you bleſſed and truly happy. Not to a feaſt of twelve daies, but to a feaſt that laſts al the twelve moneths of the yeare, to a continuing, and a continuall feaſt. How glad are many when they may goe to a feaſt? Lo a way to make feaſts for your ſelves. What a credit is it counted in the world for a man to keep a good, and great houſe, to keep feaſting and open-houſe for all commers, during the Feſtivity of the twelve dayes? Would we have this credit of good houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping, not for twelve dayes but for all the yeare long? Get good conſciences, keepe good conſciences. There is no ſuch <hi>good houſe-keeper,</hi> as is the <hi>good conſcience-keeper;</hi> for a good conſcience is a feaſt, a continuall feaſt.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing that men deſire more
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:262:106"/> then to live merrily, and how many ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at Religion, and keeping of a good conſcience, under an idle conceit that it is the way to marre all their mirth, and to make a man lumpiſh and melancholly. Do not believe the devill, do not believe his lying agents? It is a prophane Proverbe, that <hi>Spiritus Calvinianus est ſpiritus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicus.</hi> A good conſcience is a feaſt, a feaſt with all dainties, muſick, and wine. Can a man be melancholly at a feaſt, at ſo joyfull, and ſo ſweet a feaſt? doth feaſting make men melancholly, or make men merry? make men weepe, or laugh? If a man ſhould cry downe feaſting with this argument, That it makes men melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, would not all men laugh him to ſcorn? And why then ſhould a man feare melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly more from a good conſcience, than from a feaſt? There is none lives ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a life as hee that keepes a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, hee is every day at a feaſt, hee is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes banquetting. Yea, the worſt diſhes of this feaſt, even thoſe at the lower end of the Table, are better than the moſt choice rarities of other feaſts. The very teares that a good conſcience ſheds have more joy and pleaſure in them, than the worlds greateſt joyes. And if the teares
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:262:106"/> of a good conſcience be ſuch, what is the mirth and laughter of it? If weeping be ſo ſweet, what is ſinging? If the courſer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes be ſo dainty, what are the beſt ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Would wee then live merrily, and paſſe our dayes jocundly indeed? Get a good conſcience and thou keepeſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall feaſt, and that continuall feaſt will keepe thee in continuall mirth, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall joy. Yea, though thou be in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and under croſſes, ſo as thy dayes unto the world may ſeeme exceedingly evill, ſhalt thou live merrily as at a feaſt. Yea, this is the ſcope of the Scripture, <hi>All the dayes of the afflicted are evill,</hi> namely, in the eye and judgement of the world: <hi>but a good conſcience,</hi> namely, to the afflicted, <hi>is a continuall feaſt.</hi> A good conſcience feaſts then, and turnes faſting dayes into feaſting dayes. A good conſcience feaſts a man in his poverty, in his ſickneſſe, in the priſon, and cheeres up a man with many a dainty bit. The wine of this feaſt makes them forget all their ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Now then that we would be ſo wiſe as to hearken to Gods invitation to this feaſt, <hi>Let us keep the feaſt with the bread of ſincerity and truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8. Take heed now that we put not off God as thoſe did,

So doe many, urge them to the keeping of a good conſcience, and their anſwer is, If they ſhould be ſo preciſe, how ſhould they live, they ſhall have but poore takings if they take ſuch a courſe, <hi>I pray have me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed,</hi> I muſt live. Thus they anſwer, as many good husbands, when invited to frequent feaſtings, doe, No believe mee it will not hold out, if I goe every day a feaſting, I may goe one day a begging, I muſt follow my buſineſſe, and let feaſting goe. And ſo ſay men here. But take heed of putting off God thus. The time will come that thou wouldſt give all thine ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to have but the ſcraps &amp; crums of this feaſt, and thou ſhalt not have them, God will ſerve thee as hee did them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 24. <hi>None of thoſe men which were bidden ſhall</hi> taſte <hi>of my ſupper.</hi> Thoſe that care not to keep the feaſt of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhall never come to Gods feaſt in heaven. If you refuſe to come to his feaſt now, God will at the laſt day thruſt you out of doores, when you will be preſſing and crowding in, and ſhall ſay to you, Get you hence ye deſpiſers of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, you ſcorned the feaſt of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,

                     <p>Come wee now to a <hi>third motive,</hi> that <note place="margin">The third motive to a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> may yet helpe to ſtir up our minds to this neceſſary duty of getting and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of a good conſcience. Beſides what hath beene ſaid, it is worthy of our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that without a good conſcience all our actions, yea our very beſt ſervices to God are ſo farre from goodneſſe and acceptance, that they are abominable and diſtaſtefull unto the Lord. The formall goodneſſe of every mans actions is to be judged and eſteemed by the goodneſſe of his conſcience, which being evill and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, makes all a mans actions to be ſuch, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>The end of the commandement is love.</hi> But what kind of love doth the commandement require, will any ſhewes or ſhadowes of obedience ſerve the turn? will the bare dutydoing paſſe for currant?
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:262:108"/> No, but ſuch love to God and man, and ſuch performance of obedience, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from <hi>a pure heart and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> So that let a man doe all outward actions of obedience, yet if a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be wanting, all is nothing, <hi>For the end of the Commandement is love out of a good conſcience.</hi> As is a mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo are all his workes, and therefore nothing acceptable that a wicked man doth, becauſe hee doth it with an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. <hi>To the pure all things are pure,</hi> but to the defiled their conſcience is defiled, and that being defiled, it defiles all it med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles with, as under the Law the Leaper defiled all he touched. The beſt meat, diſht and dreſſed with defiled and dirty hands, is loathſome to us.</p>
                     <p>The honeſt works of a mans calling are good workes in themſelves, but no good workes to him that doth them without a good conſcience, <hi>Pro.</hi> 21. 4. <hi>An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked is Sin.</hi> The calling of Husbandry is counted the moſt honeſt calling of all others, yet where a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, a mans very plowing is Sin. Come to holy duties of Religion and Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and how is it with a man wanting
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:262:108"/> a good conſcience in them? That curſe of <hi>Davids, Pſal.</hi> 109. 8. <hi>Let his prayer be turned into Sin,</hi> lies upon the ſervices of all evill conſciences. See <hi>Pro.</hi> 15. 8. <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked,</hi> that is, of him that hath an evill conſcience, <hi>is an abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but the prayer of the upright,</hi> that is, of a man that hath a good and upright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>is his delight.</hi> Obſerve the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Hee ſayes not the <hi>prayer</hi> of the wicked, and the <hi>prayer</hi> of the upright, nor the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of the wicked, and the <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> of the upright; but the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of the wicked, and the <hi>prayer</hi> of the upright. A ſacrifice had prayer with it, but yet it was more ſumptuous &amp; more ſolemn then ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle prayer. Now who would not thinke but ſuch coſt ſhould make a man welcom, yet the ſingle prayer of the upright is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, whilſt his ſacrifice is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea, and that a vile abomination, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 66. 3. A man of evill conſcience deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in his abominations, makes his holieſt ſervices ſuch.

See therefore how <hi>Paul</hi> ſerves God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Whom I ſerve from my forefathers with pure conſcience.</hi> It is an <hi>impure ſervice</hi> that is not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a <hi>pure conſcience,</hi> as ſleight as the world make of puritie. <hi>How much more ſhal the blood of Chriſt purge your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences from dead workes, Heb.</hi> 9. 14. But to what end are they purged? <hi>To ſerve the living God.</hi> Therfore marke, that till the conſcience be <hi>purged</hi> and made good,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:262:109"/> there is no <hi>ſerving of God.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Let us draw neere,</hi> that is, in prayer, and the like duties; But how? <hi>Having our hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience.</hi> Otherwiſe it is but a folly for us to draw neere, for God will not be neere when a good conſcience is far off. And therfore we are bid to <hi>purifie our hearts,</hi> when wee are bid <hi>draw nigh</hi> to God, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
                     <p>Behold here then a ſpeciall motive to make a good conſcience beautifull in our eye. As we would be loath our ſervices of God, our prayers and holy performances, ſhould be abominable in Gods eye, ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for good conſciences. As we would have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort in alour duties of obedience, ſo labor to make our conſcience good. It is a great deale of confidence that ſilly ignorant ones have in their <hi>good prayers,</hi> &amp; their <hi>good ſerving</hi> of God, as they call it, yea it is all the ground of their hope of ſalvation, when they are demanded an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their hope: now alas your good prayers, and your good ſerving of God! why what do you talking of theſe things? Hath Chriſt <hi>purged your conſciences from dead workes?</hi> Have you by faith got your <hi>conſciences ſprinkled,</hi> and rinced in Chriſts blood, and ſo have ye made them good?
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:262:110"/> If not, never talke of <hi>good prayers,</hi> and <hi>good ſerving</hi> of God: your prayers cannot be good whilſt your conſciences are naught.

The faith is a rich commoditie, a precious fraught, and a good conſcience is the bottome, and the veſſell wherein it is caried. So long as the ſhip is ſafe and good, ſo long the goods therin are ſafe; but if the ſhip ſplit upon the Rocks, or have but a leake therein, then are all the goods therein in danger of being loſt and caſt away. So long as a man keeps a good conſcience, there is no feare of loſing the faith, the integrity and ſoundnes of the doctrin therof. <hi>Conſtancie</hi> in the truth, is a fruit of good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119. 54, 55. <hi>I have kept thy Law;</hi> he had not declined from, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the truth of God, but what held and kept him? <hi>This I had, becauſe I kept thy</hi>

                        <hi>precepts.</hi> Keeping of a good conſcience will keepe a man in the truth: It is that which is the holy preſervative to ſave from all errors, hereſies, &amp; falſe doctrins. The better conſcience, the ſounder judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſounder heart, the ſounder head. As the better digeſtion in the ſtomach, the ſreer the head is from aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dent fumes that would diſtemper and trouble the ſame, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 17. <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine whether it be of God.</hi> How ſhall a man come to have a ſound and a good judgement, to be able to judge what is truth, and what is not? Let him get a good conſcience, and make conſcience of <hi>doing the will of God, Iohn</hi> 14. 21. <hi>Hee that hath my commandements and keepes them, &amp;c.</hi> ſuch a man hath, and keepes a good conſcience.

                     <p> So that he that hath a good conſcience, hath the onely Antidote, the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Amulet and plague-cake at his breſt that is in the world, to ſave him from the peſtilence, and infection of Popery, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſme, Browniſme, Anabaptiſme, &amp;c. So long as the Ship of conſcience is whole, ſo long the Iewell of faith is ſafe. <hi>Paul</hi> would have a Biſhop <hi>to hold faſt the faithfull Word,</hi> and to be ſound in doctrin, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 9. But yet marke it, that he would firſt have him be a man of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the two foregoing verſes.

                     </p>
                     <p>Contrarily, nothing ſo endangers the loſſe of the faith and truth, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of doctrine, as doth the loſſe of good conſcience.

So thoſe Prophets that made not conſcience in faithfull and holy execution of their office, ſee what was the fruit of their evill conſcience, <hi>Micah</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Therefore night ſhall be unto you that ye ſhall not have a viſion, and it ſhall be darke unto you, that ye ſhall not divine, and the Sun ſhall goe downe over the Prophets, and the day ſhall be darke over them, &amp;c.</hi> Their darkneſſe in life ſhall be plagued with darkneſſe in judgement.

                     <p>And what is the reaſon that Popery gets ground ſo faſt, and ſo many turne Papiſts ſo eaſily? Surely it is no wonder, how ſhould it be otherwiſe, when men either having loſt all good conſcience, or making no conſcience of their wayes, but living looſely, viciouſly, and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, have thereby prepared a way for Antichriſt, and his Religion, to enter withall ſucceſſe.

We may ſay of the evill conſcience, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes of the drunkard, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23. 29. <hi>Who hath woe? who hath ſorrow? who hath contentions? who hath wounds,</hi> but not <hi>without a cauſe?</hi> Even the man whoſe conſcience is not good, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven he that liues in an evill conſcience.</p>
                     <p>An evill conſcience, how miſerable it is, we may ſee by conſidering the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie thereof, either <hi>in this world,</hi> or the <hi>world to come.</hi>

                     <p>An evill conſcience, even makes thoſe feare fearefull feares, of whom all other ſtand in feare. How potent a Monarch, and how dreadfull a Prince was <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> who was able to put him into any feare, whom all the earth feared? And yet when his guilty conſcience lookes him in the face, awakened by the palme writing on the wall, ſee where his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is then, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Then the Kings countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, ſo that the joynts of his loynes were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt another.</hi> Who would have had his feare to have had his kingdome? Let him now cloath himſelfe with all his Majeſtie, let him looke and ſpeak as terribly as he can,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:262:115"/> let him threaten the vileſt vaſſall in his Court, with all the tortures that tyranny can inflict, and let him try if he can for his heart put his pooreſt ſubject into that fright and feare that now his conſcience puts him into, in the ruffe, and middſt of his jollity. But I pray what ayles he to be in this feare, in this ſo extraordinary a feare? Hee can neither reade, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the writing upon the wall. Indeed it threatned him the loſſe of his kingdome, but hee cannot reade his threatning, hee knowes not whether they be bitter things that God writes againſt him, why may he not hope that it may bee good which is written, and why may not this hope eaſe, and abate his feare? No, no. Though he cannot reade nor underſtand the writing, yet his guilty conſcience can comment ſhrewdly upon it, and can tell him it por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends no good towards him. His conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence now tells him of his godleſſe impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in profaning the veſſels of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the true God, and that for this his ſacrilegious impropriation, and abuſe of holy things, God is now come to reckon with him. Thus can his conſcience doe more than all his wiſe men. <hi>All the wiſe men came in, but they could not reade the</hi>

                        <hi>writing, nor make knowne to the King the interpretation thereof. Dan.</hi> 5. 8. But his conſcience is wiſer than all his wiſe men, and when they are as puzzeld, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets to him, that this writing meanes him no good, and though he cannot reade the ſyllables, yet his conſcience gives a ſhrewd neere gueſſe at the ſubſtance of the writing; and therefore hence comes that extaſie of feare, and thoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſmes of horror.</p>
                     <p>It was better with <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall. After his Sin committed, we find him in a great feare, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8, 10. and hee hides himſelfe for feare. Now obſerve how his feare is deſcribed from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the time. <hi>They heard the voyce of the Lord God, walking in the garden in the coole of the day.

So that in this ſenſe it may be ſaid of an evill conſcience, which of the Lord is ſaid in another, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 139. 12. Vnto <hi>it the darkneſſe, and the light are both alike.</hi> As full of feare in the light as in the dark. And beſides, the Lord came but in a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wind, the coole breath of the day, now what a ſmall matter is a coole wind, and that in the day time to, to put a man in a feare? Such ſmall things breed great feares in evill conſciences. In what a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plight would <hi>Adam</hi> (thinke we) have beene, if the Lord had come to him, at the dead, and darke midde-night with earth-quakes, thunder, and bluſtring tempeſt?</p>
                     <p>We may ſee the like in <hi>Cain.</hi> After he had defiled his conſcience with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers blood, in what feares, yea, what idle feares lived hee? Hee is ſo haunted with feares, that though he had lived in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, yet had he lived in a land of <hi>Nod,</hi> in a land of <hi>agitation,</hi> yea, of trepidation.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:262:116"/> Iudge what caſe his evill conſcience made him in, by that ſpeech, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe, that every one that finds me ſhall ſlay me.</hi> Surely there could not bee many yet in the world, and thoſe that were in the world, were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his parents, brethren, ſiſters, or neere kindred, his feare ſeemes to imagine mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of people that might meete him, yea, and that every one hee meets would murther him. What, will his Father or Mother be his executioners? What if any of his ſiſters meet him, ſhal they ſlay him? is not ſuch a ſwaſh-buckler as he, able to make good his party with them? Lo what fearfull, and terrible things a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience projects.</p>
                     <p>As an evill conſcience is miſerable in its <hi>feares,</hi> ſo in thoſe <hi>perplexities</hi> which this feare breeds. Theſe perplexities doe miſerably and reſtleſſely diſtract a man. <hi>Iſay.</hi> 57. 20. <hi>The wicked are like the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Sea, when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt.</hi> What is the reaſon of theſe trouble ſome perplexities? The want of peace of a good conſcience, <hi>verſe</hi> 21. <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked.</hi> The winds make the ſea reſtleſſe, and ſtirre it to the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:262:117"/> ſo as the waters caſt up mire and dirt. See in the troubled Sea, the Emblem of a troubled conſcience.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Torment</hi> exceeds all, and the maine miſery of an evill conſcience lies in that. It is a miſery to be in feare, a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to have inward turbulencie, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, but to be alwayes on the racke, alwayes on the Strapado, this is far more truly the ſuburbs of Hell, than is the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh purgatory.

Evill conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being awakened, will fill the heart with ſuch feares, as a man ſhall have little liberty to ſleep. Oh the ſweet ſleep that <hi>Iacob</hi> had, and the ſweet dreame, when he lay upon the cold earth, and had an hard ſtone under his head for his pillow. An hard lodging, and an hard pillow, but yet ſweet reſt, and ſweet communion with God. A good conſcience makes any lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoft and eaſie; but downe-beds, and down-pillowes, if there be thornes in the conſcience, are but beds of thornes, and beds of nettles. The bitterneſſe of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill conſcience diſtaſtes all the ſweets of this life, as when the mouth and tongue is furred in an hot Ague, all meates and drinks are bitter to the ſicke party. This is the miſery of an evil conſcience awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this life.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But it may be many never feele this miſery here, there is therefore the more miſery reſerved for them in hell, in the world to come. Indeed more by many

                     <p>The torments which an evill conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence puts the damned to in hell, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the expreſſion of the tongue, and the comprehenſion of mans conceit. There be two ſpeciall things in the torments of Hell, wee have them both thrice repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 44, 46, 48. <hi>Where their</hi> worme <hi>dies not, and the</hi> fire <hi>is not</hi>
                        <pb n="228" facs="tcp:262:121"/> 
                        <hi>quenched.</hi> There is an ever-living <hi>worme,</hi> and never-dying <hi>fire.</hi> And marke that in all the three verſes the <hi>worme</hi> is ſet in the firſt place, as it were to teach us, that the prime and principal torment in hell is the <hi>worme,</hi> rather than the <hi>fire.</hi> And what is the <hi>worme,</hi> but the guilt of an evill conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſhall lye eternally gnawing and graſping, twitching, and griping, the heart of the damned in hell? Men talke much of hell fire, and it were well they would talke more of it; but yet there is another torment forgotten, that would be thought on too. There is an <hi>Hell worm,</hi> as well as there is an <hi>Hell fire.</hi> And it may be a queſtion whether of the two is the greateſt torment. And yet no great queſtion neither. For as the Heaven of Heauen, is the peace and joy of a good, ſo the very Hell of Hell, is the guilt and and worme of an evill conſcience. A man may ſafely ſay, it is better being in hell with a good conſcience, than to be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if that might be, with an evill one. Heaven without a good conſcience, what is it better than hel? Paradice was an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on earth, but when <hi>Adam</hi> had loſt the Paradice of a good conſcience, what joy did paradice, &amp; the pleaſures of the garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <pb n="229" facs="tcp:262:121"/> afford him more, than if he had beene in ſome ſad and ſolitary Deſert? A good conſcience makes a Deſert a Paradice, an evill one turnes a Paradice into a Deſert. A good conſcience makes Hell to be no Hell, and an evil one makes Heaven to be no Heaven. Both the happines, and miſery of Heaven and Hell, are from the inward frame of the conſcience. The Hell of Hell, is the worm of Hell, and that worm is the worm of an evill conſcience, which if it be not wormed out, and ſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in this life made good, it will be an immortall worme in Hell.</p>
                     <p>The helliſh deſpaire wherewith the damned are overwhelmed, comes rather from this <hi>worm,</hi> than from the <hi>fire.</hi> Whoſe <hi>worm</hi> dies not, and whoſe <hi>fire</hi> is not quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. The <hi>fire</hi> of Hell never quenches, becauſe the <hi>worme</hi> of Hell never dies. If the <hi>worme</hi> of Hell would die, the <hi>fire</hi> of Hell would go out. For if there were no guilt, there ſhould be no puniſhment. So that the very Hell of Hell, is that ſelf-tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which an evill conſcience breeds.</p>
                     <p>Now then all this conſidered, how powerfully ſhould it move us to labour for a good conſcience. Thou that goeſt on in thine evill courſes, and hateſt to be

                     <p>But eſpecially as thou feareſt that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verliving and ever grabbing worme, ſo have a care to get a good conſcience.

The forbidden and raw fruits of Sin, are thoſe which breed Cheſtwormes in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The corruptions of the ſoule, and dead workes are thoſe that breed this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving worme, take heed therfore of med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with theſe fruits that will breed this worme, and get thy conſcience purged from dead works, get this worme killed with the ſooneſt, for if thou letteſt it live till thou dye, it will never die at all, and will put thee to thoſe exquiſite torments, from which to be freed, thou wouldſt

                     <p>As then I ſay thou feareſt this <hi>worme</hi> of Hell, ſo get a good conſcience. Drink downe every morning a hearty draught of Chriſts blood, which may make this worme burſt. And when once this worm is burſt and voyded, and the conſcience well purged by Chriſts blood, take heed ever after of eating thoſe raw fruits that will breed new wormes. Lead ſo holy, ſo upright, and ſo conſcionable a life, that thou mayeſt not by thy freſh Sins clog thy conſcience with freſh guilt. Get thy conſcience purged by Chriſts blood, and thy converſation framed by Gods Word. <hi>Thy words were found by me, and I did eate them, Ier.</hi> 15. 16.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> had begun his defence in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe, and that by authoritie and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall command, as appeares in the former Chapter, at the 30. ver. But he had no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner begun, but he is interrupted &amp; cut off, and hath not onely his mouth ſtopt, but ſtopt with <hi>Ananias</hi> fiſt, <hi>He commanded to ſmite him on the mouth.</hi> Out of which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and violence of his, wee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve divers things. Firſt learne;</p>
                     <p>What is the <hi>Reward and portion of a good conſcience from the world.</hi> It is the portion of a good conſcience full oft to be ſmitten, either on the mouth, or with the mouth. Blowes either with the fiſt, or with the tongue. <hi>To be ſmitten</hi> one way or other, is full often the lot of a good conſcience. <hi>Smite him on the mouth,</hi> ſayes
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:262:123"/> 
                        <hi>Ananias.</hi> But let us a little expoſtulate the matter with <hi>Ananias. Smite him on the mouth?</hi> But yet as <hi>Pilate</hi> ſpeaks in Chriſts caſe, <hi>But what evill hath he done?</hi> or what evill hath hee ſpoken? <hi>Smite him on the mouth?</hi> But as our Saviour anſwers, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. 23. <hi>If he have ſpoken evil, take witneſſe of the evill,</hi> and proceed legally and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally: <hi>If he have ſpoken well,</hi> or no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of evill, <hi>why commandeſt thou him to be ſmitten?</hi> What, hath he ſpoken any trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or the Roman govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If he have, then as the town-clark of <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 38. <hi>The Law is open, and there are Deputies,</hi> let them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him; and bring him to his anſwer. It is a baſe uſage of an ingenuous perſon, to be ſmitten on the mouth in a Court of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, a diſhonourable uſage of a Roman. Surely it ſhould ſeeme by ſuch baſe and bitter uſage, that <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſome way or other fouly forgotten and overſhot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that <hi>Ananias</hi> his ſpirit is thus embi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and provoked againſt him. What, hath <hi>Paul</hi> given him any exaſperating and diſgracefull termes, hath he given him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny open and perſonall girds, before the whole Councell? No, no: No ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at all. Why what then is the matter
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:262:124"/> that <hi>Paul</hi> muſt be thus baſely, and thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully uſed? Will ye know the cauſe? <hi>Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conſcience?</hi> Loe here is the quarrell. He hath made a profeſſion of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and for his good conſcience ſake are <hi>Ananias</hi> fiſts about his eares. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo mads men of wicked conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as the profeſſion &amp; practice of a good conſcience doth. The very name &amp; men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a good conſcience makes <hi>Ananias</hi> halfe mad, &amp; like one beſides himſelfe he fals not onely to foule words, but to blowes alſo, and <hi>Paul</hi> muſt have it on the mouth for good conſcience ſake.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> might have blaſphemed the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed name of Chriſt, and rayled upon the odious Sect of the Nazarens, hee might have beene a drunkard, an adulterour, or a murtherer, and none of all theſe things would have ſtirred <hi>Ananias</hi> his blood, for none of all theſe ſhould <hi>Paul</hi> have been ſmitten; but let him but once ſpeak, or treate of, or any way meddle with good conſcience, and <hi>Ananias</hi> his blood is preſently up, hee cannot hold his hands, but <hi>Paul</hi> muſt have on the mouth, there is no remedy. So odious a thing is good conſcience and the profeſſion of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:262:124"/> it to wicked men. Therefore this is that which a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce muſt expect, even <hi>Ananias</hi> his dole, fiſts, blowes, ſmiting hard &amp; injurious meaſure from the world.</p>
                     <p>This is no new thing. It was our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours caſe before it was <hi>Pauls, Ioh.</hi> 18. 22. <hi>And when he had thus ſpoken, one of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers which ſtood by ſtrucke Ieſus with the palme of his hand, &amp;c.</hi> Lu. 22. 63, 64. <hi>And the men that held Ieſus, mocked him, and ſmote him, And when they had blind-folded him, they ſtroke him on the face.</hi> He felt the weight of their fiſts for the ſame quarrell that <hi>Paul</hi> did. So it was fore-prophecied of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 6. <hi>I gave my backe to the ſmiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the haire.</hi> It was the kindneſſe that <hi>Zid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> could afford <hi>Micaiah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 24. <hi>He went neere, and ſmote him on the cheeke,</hi> &amp; it was the thanks the Prophet was like to have for the diſcharge of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 25. 16. <hi>Forbear, why ſhouldſt thou be ſmitten?</hi> It is that of which <hi>Iob</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained ſo long ſince, <hi>Iob</hi> 16. 10. <hi>Mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ſharpens his eyes upon me, they have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon me with the mouth, they have ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten me upon the cheeke reproachfully.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame portion ſhall the Prophet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> meet withall, <hi>Ier.</hi> 20. 2. <hi>Then Paſhur</hi>
                        <pb n="236" facs="tcp:262:125"/> 
                        <hi>ſmote Ieremiah the Prophet.</hi> What was the quarrell? That in the former verſ. <hi>Hee heard that Ieremiah had prophecied theſe things.</hi> Only for diſcharging his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for the conſcionable diſpenſation of Gods truth. And as ſometime they ſmote him on the mouth, ſo ſomtime they ſmote him with the mouth, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. 18. <hi>Come let us deviſe devices againſt Ieremiah, come let us ſmite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.</hi> And why would they ſmite him with the tongue? Onely for his conſcience, and fidelity in his Miniſtery.</p>
                     <p>There is mention made of two falſe Prophets, againſt whom an heavie judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is threatned, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29. 21, 23. <hi>Ahab</hi> &amp; <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> two baſe ſcandalous debauched perſons, who <hi>committed villany in Iſrael, and committed adultery with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors wives.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> he out of conſcience fulfils his Miniſtry, &amp; ſee how light-fingred <hi>Paſhur</hi> is, he hath fiſts for <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remies</hi> face, and ſtocks for his heeles; but in the meane time <hi>Ahab</hi> &amp; <hi>Zedekiah</hi> they may whore, &amp; play the villains, and they feele not the weight of his little finger. If his fingers muſt needs be walking, there is worke for them, there he may ſtrike, and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:262:125"/> ſtocke with credit. But there is no ſuch zeale againſt them. No ſuch dealing with them. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> may be in good tearmes of grace with <hi>Paſhur,</hi> whilſt <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> muſt have blowes on the face, &amp; ly by the heeles. So well can wicked men brook villany, and any wretched courſes better than they can a good conſcience: <hi>Paſhur</hi> can better endure an aduletrous whoremaſter, than an honeſt conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prophet: villaines may wall at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whilſt a good conſcience ſhal ſit in the ſtocks. Heere then is the portion a good conſcience may look for from the world. The better conſcience, the harder mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>For which of my good works do ye ſtone me?</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 32. A ſtrange recompence for good works, and yet oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the beſt recompence and reward that the world can afford good works, and a good conſcience, ſtones and ſtrokes. And if ſo be that feare of law, and happy government bind their hands, yet then will they bee ſmiting with the tongue: and if the law keep them in awe for ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the mouth, yet then will they do what they dare, they will ſmite with the mouth.</p>

Do as many do in caſe of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, before they affect the perſon, they firſt conſider how they like the portion. So heere before thou meddle with good conſcience, thinke with thy ſelfe what is her portion, and if thou like not that, it is but a folly to think of a good conſcience. Do as our Saviour adviſes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 28. Sit down firſt &amp; count the coſt, and whether thou be able to endure that coſt or no. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> hath a fierce ſpirit, and a foule hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie fiſt, <hi>Paſhur</hi> is a club fiſted fellow, and the ſpitting adders of the world will ſmite their ſting deepe. Suppoſe a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may ſpeed better, as having the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Chriſtian government, yet this it muſt reckon upon, and it muſt account of the hardeſt.

                     <p>I may ſay here as our Saviour did to the Sons of <hi>Zebedeus, Mat.</hi> 20. 20, 21. <hi>Ye know not what ye aske. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I ſhall drink of, and to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the baptiſme that I am baptized with?</hi> Many ſay they deſire to enter the courſes of a good conſcience, but doe not

Conſider with your ſelves, Are ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to drink of the cup that a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall drinke of? Can ye be baptized with the baptiſme that a good conſcience muſt be baptized with? Can ye indure the ſmart of <hi>Ananias</hi> blows? Can ye bear the load of <hi>Paſhurs</hi> club fiſt? Think upon this aforehand, and weight it well, this is that you muſt make account of, that will ſet upon the courſes of a good conſcience.</p>

One blow on the heart, or with the heart, is more painefull than an hundred on the face, and as <hi>Rehoboam</hi> ſpeaks of himſelfe, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 10. ſo conſciences little finger is thicker, heavier, and more intollerable
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:262:127"/> than both <hi>Ananias</hi> his hands and loynes. Now then here is the caſe.

If <hi>Paul</hi> do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake or flawe good conſcience for feare, or for the favour of <hi>Ananias,</hi> then will conſciences fiſt be about his heart. Now then if no remedy but a man muſt have blowes, it is good wiſedome to chuſe the lighteſt fiſt, and the ſofter hand, and to take the blow on that part that is beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to beare it with moſt eaſe. The face is better able to abide blows than the heart, and <hi>Ananias</hi> his blowes are but fillips to the clubbing blowes of conſcience. We would ſcarce judge him a wiſe man, that to avoyd a cuffe on the eare, would put himſelfe under the danger of a blow with a club. Here is that then that may make us to compoſe our ſelves to patience, and to grow to an hardineſſe and a Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. Better ten blowes on the face, than one on the heart. Better an hundred from <hi>Ananias,</hi> than one from conſcience, that will lay on load; let the world ſmite, yet mine heart ſmites not, yea, that ſtrokes and comforts, whilſt the world ſtrikes and threatens. Therefore being ſmitten in caſe of conſcience, rather than give out, do as
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:262:128"/> our Saviour bids in another caſe, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 39. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on the right cheeke turne to him the other alſo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Conſider that in the next verſe, <hi>God ſhall ſmite thee.</hi> God hath ſmiting fiſts as well as <hi>Ananias.</hi> Let him ſmite, but yet there will come a time that God ſhall ſmite him? God will call ſmiters to a reckoning.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Conſider that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Thou haſt ſmitten all mine enemies upon the cheeke bone, thou haſt broken the teeth of the ungodly.</hi> God will not onely ſmite the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of his people, but will ſmite them with diſgrace, as it is a matter of vile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to have a boxe on the cheeke, and hee will give them ſuch a <hi>duſt</hi> on the mouth as ſhall daſh out their very teeth; he will lay heavie and diſgracefull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them, as he did upon <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> of whom <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes.</p>
                     <p>May it ever be thy lot to ſee good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience under the fiſts of ſmiters, be not diſcouraged, ſtart not, ſtumble not at it.

But conſider, that this hath been ever the worlds madneſſe, and the ancient lot of a good conſcience,

                     <p>
                        <hi>The heady violence, and impetuous inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi>

                        <hi>of the adverſaries of good conſcience. Smite him on the mouth.</hi> A man would not imagine that hatred and malice againſt goodneſſe, ſhould ſo tranſport a man as to make him run into ſo much, ſo open, ſo groſſe Injuſtice. Doe but examine the fact, and you ſhall ſee a ſtrange deale of injuſtice therein.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Who is he that bids ſmite?</hi> The high Prieſt. He had a better Canon to live by, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>He walked with me in peace and equity.</hi> So <hi>Levi</hi> walked, &amp; ſo ſhould Gods
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:262:129"/> Prieſts walke alſo. And that Canon of <hi>Paul</hi> for the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, held no leſſe good for the Miniſtry of the law, That he ſhould <hi>not be ſoone angry, no ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Tit.</hi> 1. 7. How haps it then that the High Prieſt is thus light fingred. <hi>Smite him on the mouth?</hi> Oh! ſhame that ſuch a word ſhould come out of a Prieſts, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the High Prieſts mouth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Who muſt be ſmitten? Paul</hi> an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Foule injuſtice. Queſtionleſſe if <hi>Paul</hi> had offered ſuch meaſure but to <hi>Ananias</hi> his dog, to have ſmitten him for nothing, but out of his meer ſpight, <hi>Ananias</hi> would have judged him a dogged fellow. And would <hi>Ananias</hi> uſe an innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perſon as he would be loth a man ſhould uſe his dog?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Where muſt this blow be given?</hi> In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Court, where they were all convened to doe juſtice. Still the worſe. If he had commanded him to have been ſmitten in his private Parlour, it had been unjuſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but to ſmite him in open Court, and to doe injuſtice in the place of Iuſtice, this is deepe injuſtice. The place he ſate in, the gravity of his perſon, Gods High Prieſt, the ſolemnity of the adminiſtration of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, all theſe might have manacled his hands, and have a little tempered and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:262:129"/> his ſpirit. A foule indignity for the <hi>Iudge of Iſrael to bee ſmitten on the cheeke, Mic.</hi> 5. 1. As foule an iniquity for a Iudge of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſmite on the mouth wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in an open Court of Iuſtice. What an indecent thing for a Iudge to goe to cuffes on the Bench? What an intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and a vindictive ſpirit argues it? But what is the Indency to the Injuſtice? And what Injuſtice to that which was done upon the Bench? Of all wormwood that is the moſt bitter, into which juſtice is turned.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>For what is the blow given?</hi> For a good conſcience. What? And hath Gods High Prieſt no more conſcience than ſo, his place teaches him to bee a Protector, Defender, and an Incourager of good conſcience. His whole office is matter of conſcience, and will he that ſhould teach, maintaine, and incourage good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will he ſmite men for good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? What is this but <hi>Iſ.</hi> 58. 4. <hi>To ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſſe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>When is the blow given?</hi> When he is begining to plead his own innocencie, &amp; to ſpeake in his own defence. More inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice yet. Did not <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſpeake rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 51. <hi>Doth our Law judge any man</hi>
                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:262:130"/> 
                        <hi>before it heare him?</hi> Nay, if <hi>Ananias</hi> have no regard to Gods Law, as it ſeemes hee hath but a little, that will ſmite a man for good conſcience, yet what will he ſay to <hi>Caeſars</hi> Law? <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 25. <hi>Is it lawfull for you to ſcourage,</hi> and ſo to ſmite, <hi>a man that is a Roman and uncondemned,</hi> and unheard? To judge and condemne a man unheard, is deep Injuſtice, but far deeper to puniſh, and execute him. Will hee hang a man, and then try him? Lo here indeed a right unrighteous Iudge, that feares neither God, nor man, that regards neither Gods Law, nor <hi>Caeſars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To have done by <hi>Paul</hi> as <hi>Gallio</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 14, 16. When <hi>Paul</hi> was about to open his mouth, to drive him and the reſt from the judgement-ſeat, this had beene inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but when <hi>Paul</hi> opens his mouth to ſpeake for himſelf, for <hi>Ananias</hi> to ſtop his mouth, and to ſtop it with his fiſts, to ſtop his mouth, and ſmite him on the mouth both, when he was to ſpeake in his owne defence, what greater depth of Injuſtice can we imagine? An hundred to one but <hi>Ananias</hi> was one of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> which at the time when the officers not having apprehended Chriſt, fell a curſing the people, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 49. <hi>This people that knowes</hi>
                        <pb n="247" facs="tcp:262:130"/> 
                        <hi>not the Law is curſed.</hi> Vpon which ſpeech <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſeemes to meet kindly with them, <hi>ver.</hi> 51. <hi>Doth our Law judge any man before it heare and know what he doth?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Do you glory in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the law, and are they curſed that know not the law, what then are they that knowing the Law goe directly againſt it? are the people, <hi>Ananias,</hi> curſed that know not the Law, what art thou thy ſelfe then who knowſt both Gods Law and <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and yet through malice againſt <hi>Paul</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt againſt both? Vnjuſt and malicious proceedings, God will not let them have the honor ſo much as of the colour of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, and legality in their courſes. But they ſhall be ſo carried, that the madneſſe and malice of them, may ly manifeſtly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the view of all the world.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>By what authority is the blow given? Ananias</hi> commanded them. Yea but <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>The Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and they ſhould ſeeke the Law at his mouth.</hi> And ſhould they that ſhould ſeeke the Law at his mouth, againſt all law at his command, ſmite men on the mouth? It was too much that <hi>Gallio</hi> did, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt leaves a deep diſgrace upon him for it, <hi>Act.</hi> 18, that he would ſuffer others
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:262:131"/> to ſmite <hi>Soſthenes,</hi> and <hi>not to care for it.</hi> It was too much that <hi>Ahab</hi> ſuffers <hi>Zidkiah</hi> to ſmite <hi>Micaiah,</hi> and to breake the kings peace in the kings preſence, hee ſhould have condemned him at leaſt to loſe his hand, for ſtriking before the King. But here is a worſe matter, he not only ſuffers it, but commands it to be done. <hi>Ananias commanded</hi> to ſmite. Vnjuſtice <hi>ſuffered</hi> by authority is too much, but unjuſtice <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> by authority, that is far worſe.</p>

                        <pb n="254" facs="tcp:262:134"/> now take this blow at <hi>Ananias</hi> hands? He ſmites not againe, nor offers to repell one violence with another, he had learned of Chriſt rather to have turned his other cheeke to him. But yet though hee ſmite him not with the fiſt, yet he ſmites with a checke and a juſt reproofe for his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. And ſo may a man ſmite without tranſgreſſion, and without revenge, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141. 5. <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, it ſhall not breake mine head.</hi> So may a man ſmite, and yet be a righteous man. Theſe blows are not to breake heads, as <hi>Ananias</hi> his blowes are, but theſe are to breake hard hearts. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> ſmites without tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the bonds of meekneſſe and patience. And ſo we are now come to the third maine point in the text, <hi>Pauls</hi> zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous anſwer, and <hi>conteſtation.</hi>

                        <hi>hands, yet doth it not alwayes bind a mans tongue.</hi> Though it lay a Law upon a man to forbeare violence, yet layes it not a Law upon him alwayes to enjoyne him ſilence. Though a man in <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe may not ſtrike, yet hee may ſpeake. Though Religion pinion a mans armes from ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, yet doth it not ſow &amp; ſeale up a mans lips from ſpeaking. <hi>Ananias</hi> hath ſmitten <hi>Paul</hi> on the face, and if it pleaſe him to have another blow, he will not reſiſt him, hee hath his other cheeke ready for him, if his fingers itch to be doing; but yet for all this, though <hi>Paul</hi> hold his hands, hee doth not hold his peace. Indeed <hi>Chriſts</hi> precept is well known, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 39. <hi>Turne the other cheeke alſo,</hi> but yet for all that, ſee what his practice was when he was ſmitten, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. 23.

                        <hi>If I have ſpoken evill, beare witneſſe of the evill, but if well, why ſmiteſt thou me?</hi> And yet his precept and practice doe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeire, nor croſſe ſhinnes. For though by his precept hee forbids us to retaliate, or recompence injury with injury, out of the heat of a vindictive ſpirit, yet by his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice he warrants us in caſes of injury to make a manifeſtation both of our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, and others injuſtice. Religion binds no man to be a Traytour to his own innocencie, and the juſtice of his cauſe, and by ſilence to abet others injuſtice. With a good conſcience may a man ſpeake, ſo long as hee ſpeakes as <hi>Paul</hi> did before <hi>Feſtus, Act.</hi> 26. 25. <hi>The words of truth and ſoberneſſe.</hi> So a man anſwer tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſoberly, without tacks of gall, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient touches of revenge.

                        <hi>and his faithfull ſervants. Ananias</hi> ſmites <hi>Paul,</hi> and for his good conſcience, and what gets hee by it? God will ſmite him, and give him as good as hee brings. <hi>God will ſmite ſmiters. Ananias</hi> ſmites <hi>Paul,</hi> and Gods will ſmite <hi>Ananias;</hi> yea, and God did ſmite <hi>Ananias,</hi> for he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſlaine by <hi>Manaimus,</hi> one of the Captaines of the Iewes.</p>
                     <p>It is a dangerous thing not to ſmite when God commands, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 35, 36. He that would not ſmite a Prophet when God commanded, was ſmitten with an heavie judgement. It is no leſſe dangerous to ſmite when God forbids ſmiting; God hath an heavie hand for thoſe that are ſo light fingred, and he will give them blow for blow that will bee ſmiting his for a good conſcience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Touch not mine anoynted, and do my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets no harm, Pſ.</hi> 105. 15. He that touches them, touches <hi>the apple of Gods eye, Zach.</hi> 2. 8. So hee that ſmites them, ſmites the apple of his eye. The eie is a tender place, and ſenſible of a little blow. God will not take a blow on the eye, nor beare a blow on his face at the hands of the proudeſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of them all, and though we muſt turne the other cheek rather than ſmite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:262:136"/> yet the Lord to whom vengeance belongs, wil take no blows at their hands, but if they will be ſmiting, they ſhall be ſure to heare of him to their coſt.</p>
                     <p>You find <hi>Ex.</hi> 2. 11. an Aegyptian ſmiting an Iſraelite. It becomes none better than Aegyptians to be ſmiting Iſraelites. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpies an Aegyptian ſmiting of an Hebrew. What gets the Aegyptian in the end? See verſe 12. God ſtirs up the ſpirit of <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſmite him, and to ſlay him. Thus will God teach Aegyptians to be medling. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhur</hi> ſmites <hi>Ieremy, Ier.</hi> 20. 2. What got he by it? The heavie ſtroke of Gods hand upon himſelfe and all his friends, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Herod</hi> was a ſmiter too, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 1, 2. <hi>He ſtretched forth his hands to vexe certain of the Church, and he killed Iames the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Iohn with the Sword.</hi> And what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of him in the end? See ver. 23. <hi>The Angel of the Lord ſmote him, &amp; he was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten up of worms, and he gave up the ghoſt.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Ionas</hi> his gourd that a worme ſmote it, and it withered, <hi>Ion.</hi> 4. That was much that a worme ſhould ſo ſoone ſmite the gourd. But when men will be ſmiting Gods people, and his prophets for a good conſcience, and when <hi>Herod</hi> will be ſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie as to ſmite Apoſtles, God can ſend not
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:262:136"/> onely an Angel, one of his moſt glorious creatures, but even a baſe worme, even one of the weakeſt creatures to ſmite <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> and eate him both. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ſtretches forth his arme againſt the Prophet, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 13. &amp; his arm withers, he doth but threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſmite, &amp; God ſmites him. How much more when <hi>Herod</hi> ſtretches forth his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to vexe the Church, and to ſmite Gods Miniſters, wil God not only wither them, but ſmite him, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſmote the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims, <hi>hip and thigh,</hi> and make him a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and a ſtinking ſpectacle to all malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſmiters to the worlds end.</p>
                     <p>Thus is that true which the Prophet implies in that ſpeech, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 6. <hi>Hath hee ſmitten him as hee ſmote his ſmiter?</hi> Marke then Gods dealing, hee uſes to ſmite ſmiters.</p>
                     <p>Neither is this true only of ſmiters with the fiſt, and with the ſword, but it is alſo true of thoſe <hi>ſmiters, Ier.</hi> 18. 18. <hi>Come, and let us ſmite him with the tongue.</hi> Even ſuch ſmiters will God ſmite alſo, as wee may ſee there, <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22, 23. Thus God met with <hi>Nabal, David</hi> ſends for reliefe to him upon his feſtivall day, and he in ſtead of an almes fals a railing on him, and cals him, in effect, a Rogue, and a Vagabond,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:262:137"/> and a run-away. Thus hee ſmote <hi>David</hi> with his tongue. What follows? See ver. 38. <hi>And it came to paſſe about ten dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the Lord</hi> ſmote <hi>Nabal.</hi> And how ſmote he him? <hi>That he died.</hi> So <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 12. <hi>Their tongue ſhall conſume away in their mouth.</hi> What might the reaſon be of that judgment? Becauſe haply many that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or dare not fight with their hands, for fear of the law, yet fight againſt Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters &amp; his ſervants with their tongues: Wel, God hath a plague to ſmite ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Though they ſmite but with the tongue, yet God will ſmite them, and give them their portion with the reſt of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of the Church. And if God will not ſpare ſuch ſmiters, how much leſſewil he ſpare ſuch as ſmite with the ſword?</p>
                     <p>Terror to all ſmiters, either with hand <label type="milestone">

Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſearch the Hiſtories of the Church; Had ever any ſmiters peace, which lifted up either hand, or tongue againſt any of the Lords people? Did ſmiters ever ſcape
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:262:137"/> ſcot-free? Had they any cauſe to brag in the end? Had they ever any cauſe to brag of the laſt blow? Did <hi>Herod</hi> proſper that ſmote <hi>Iames</hi> with the ſword? did <hi>Ananias</hi> proſper that ſmote <hi>Paul?</hi> did the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> proſper that ſmote the <hi>Hebrew?</hi> Did <hi>Doeg</hi> proſper who was a <hi>tongue-ſmiter,</hi> as well as an <hi>hand-ſmiter, Pſa.</hi> 52. Oh conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this you that dare lift up your hands and tongues againſt a good conſcience, &amp; be afraid of Gods ſmiting hand, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to meddle in this kind. Learne to hold your hands and tongues, unleſſe yee long to feele Gods ſmiting hand.

Indeed when we will be ſmiting, wee prevent Gods ſmiting, and ſo they have the eaſier blows by the meanes: For what are our blowes to the Lords; Do as Chriſts did, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Who when hee was reviled, reviled not againe; but committed himſelf to him that judges righteouſly.</hi> It is beſt leaving them to the Lords hand. Pray for thy ſmiters, that God would give them ſmiting hearts, that their hearts may ſmite them for their ſmiting; pray to God if he ſee it good they may be ſo ſmitten. This is a revenge will ſtand with charity. Yet if not, leave them to God who beſt knows how to ſmite ſmiters.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>That looke as it is in the caſe of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo is it in the caſe of Sin.

                     <p>Thus it is alſo in the caſe of Sin; this is the rule the Lord proceeds by often in his Iuſtice, to meete with wicked men in their kind. As <hi>with the mercifull he ſhews</hi>

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:262:140"/> the Lord ſlaughters them by a fall. A fall was their Sin, a fall was their death, there was a fall for a fall.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Gods puniſhments are in the ſame kind. Look in what kind the Sin is, of the ſame kind is the puniſhment. <hi>Sodomes</hi> Sin was in fiery luſts, they were in their Sin ſet on fire from hell. Their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was of the ſame kind; God raines down fire from heaven upon them. A fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sin, and a fiery puniſhment. Memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this kind was the juſtice of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that notorious &amp; fiery perſecutor <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Gardiner,</hi> who would not ſit downe to dinner till the news came from <hi>Oxford</hi> of the fire ſet to <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Latimer;</hi> but before his meale was ended, God kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a fire in his body, which ere long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht him, &amp; made him thruſt his tongue blacke out of his mouth. Such was Gods juſtice upon <hi>Adonibesek, Iudges</hi> 1. 7. in the cutting of his thumbes and his great toes. <hi>Threeſcore and ten Kings having their thumbes and their great toes cut off, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their meat under my Table.</hi> As <hi>I have done,</hi> ſo <hi>God hath requited me.</hi> God hath met with mee in mine owne kinde, hee hath payd mee with mine owne coyne. Thus was Gods juſtice divers waies upon
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:262:141"/> the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> They threw the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> children into the waters, and ſtained the waters with <hi>blood,</hi> therefore God turnes their waters into blood. To which that place alludes, <hi>Apo.</hi> 16. 4, 5, 6. <hi>And the third Angel powred out his viall upon the waters, and fountaines of waters, and they became blood. And I heard the Angel in the water ſay, Righteous art thou O Lord, &amp;c. becauſe thou haſt judged thus, for they have ſhed the blood of Saints and Prophets; and thou haſt given them blood to drinke.</hi> Where not onely the juſtice of God, but alſo the equity thereof is magnified, not onely becauſe God had <hi>judged,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had judged <hi>thus.</hi> Again, the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> deſtroy the males of the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, God meetes with them in their kind, hee ſmites the firſt-born throughout al <hi>Egypt.</hi> The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> drowne the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in the waters, God payes them in their kind, hee drownes the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in the waters of the Red ſea, there is <hi>drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> for <hi>drowning,</hi> and <hi>waters</hi> for <hi>waters. Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> Sin by fire, and <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 2. <hi>There went out a fire from the Lord and devoured them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How many fires hath the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> kindled, wherein ſhe hath conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:262:141"/> to aſhes the Saints of God, God will plague her with an end ſuting with her ſin, <hi>Apo.</hi> 17. 16. ſhe her ſelf ſhall be burnt with fire. <hi>They ſhall eate her fleſh, and burne her with fire.</hi> There is <hi>fire</hi> for <hi>fire, Apoc.</hi> 9. 12. ſhee there darkens the light of the truth, with the ſmoake of hereſie and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>There aroſe a ſmoak out of the pit, as the ſmoake of a great furnace, and the Sun and the ayre were darkned by reaſon of the ſmoak of the pit.</hi> And <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18. 9. 18. There we find the <hi>ſmoake of his burning.</hi> There is <hi>ſmoak</hi> for <hi>ſmoak.</hi> God wil make her <hi>ſmoak</hi> in the end that hath brought ſuch a deale of ſpirituall <hi>ſmoake</hi> into his Church: and as that Emperour ſaid, <hi>Let him periſh with</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Fumo pereat qui fumum vendidit.</note> 
                        <hi>ſmoak that ſold ſmoak;</hi> ſo hath ſhee periſht with <hi>ſmoak</hi> at the laſt, that hath put out the eyes of ſo many thouſands with the <hi>ſmoak</hi> of hereſie and ſuperſtition. This was that juſtice of God which the Papiſts powder-Martyrs, <hi>Catesbie,</hi> &amp; ſome others of them were forced to acknowledge, when they who had thought to have blowne up the State with <hi>Powder,</hi> were themſelves ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with <hi>Powder,</hi> a ſparke of fire flying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, as they were drying it, and preparing for their defence.</p>
                     <p>Such is that Iuſtice of God threatned,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:262:142"/> 
                        <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 15, 16. <hi>Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that putteſt thy bottle to him, and makeſt him drunken alſo, that thou mayeſt looke on their nakedneſſe. Thou art filled with ſhame for glory, drink thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and let thy fore-skin be uncovered, the cup of the Lords right hand ſhall be turned unto thee, and ſhamefull ſpuing ſhall be on thy glory.</hi> A good place for drunkards to think upon, eſpecially ſuch whoſe glory is their ſhame, whoſe glory is to make others drunke. They ſhall have <hi>cup</hi> for <hi>cup, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe</hi> for <hi>nakedneſſe, ſpuing</hi> for <hi>ſpuing.</hi> As they have made others ſpue and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, through oppreſſion by drinke, ſo will God give them ſuch a draught of the bitter dregs, of the cup of his wrath, that ſhall make them ſpue their very hearts out, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. 27. <hi>Drinke and be drunken, and ſpue and fall, and riſe no more, becauſe of the ſword which I will ſend amongst you.</hi> Of this kind was that Iuſtice of God upon <hi>David</hi> himſelfe. He kils <hi>Vriah</hi> with the <hi>ſword,</hi> therefore the <hi>ſword</hi> ſhall not depart from his houſe; He defiles the wife of <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,</hi> therfore his Concubines are defiled by <hi>Abſalom.</hi> This is that Iuſtice, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. 10. <hi>He that leadeth into Captivity, ſhall go into Captivity; hee that killeth with the</hi>
                        <pb n="271" facs="tcp:262:142"/> 
                        <hi>ſword, muſt be killed with the ſword.</hi> It was the moſt righteous hand of God upon <hi>Saul,</hi> that he that put Gods Prieſts to the ſword ſhould fall upon his owne ſword; and juſt with God that <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, that would have kept the Deputy in ſpirituall, ſhould himſelfe be ſmitten with bodily blindneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Gods puniſhments are oft in the ſame part and member of the body, wherwith men have offended. That look as renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Granmer</hi> dealt with himſelfe at his Martyrdome; That hand wherewith he had ſubſcribed to the ſixe Articles, that hand he firſt put into the fire, in an holy revenge upon himſelfe; even ſo deales the Lord very often in his juſtice; That which men have made the Inſtrument of their Sin, God makes the ſubject of his Iudgements. <hi>Abſaloms</hi> pride, and his weakneſſe lay where <hi>Sampſons</hi> ſtrength was. <hi>Abſaloms</hi> haire was <hi>Abſaloms</hi> pride, therefore <hi>Abſaloms</hi> haire, as it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, was <hi>Abſaloms</hi> halter, and whileſt hee will needs ſpare the Barber a labour, hee alſo ſpares the Hangman a labour. Such was Gods juſtice upon <hi>Sampſon</hi> himſelfe. Hee can find none to bee the <hi>pleaſure of his eyes,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:262:143"/> of his wife, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. but <hi>Philiſtims, Iudg.</hi> 14. 2, 3. and chapter 16. 1. and ſo in the love of a <hi>Philiſtim, Dalilah,</hi> he abuſes his eyes. What is the iſſue? At laſt the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims</hi> put out his eyes. God puniſht the abuſe of his eies with the loſſe of his eies, and thoſe eyes that loved <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> were pluckt out by <hi>Philiſtims.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Memorable in this kind was Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice upon that French King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, who in a rage againſt a Proteſtant Counſellor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted him into the hands of one of his Nobles to bee impriſoned, and that with theſe words, That <hi>he would ſee him burned with his own eyes.</hi> But mark the juſtice of God within a few dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ſame Noble man with a Launce put into his hands by the King, did at a tilting run the ſaid King into one of his eyes, whereof he dyed.</p>
                     <p>Of this kind was the Iuſtice of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Zachary, Luke</hi> 1. Offending with his tongue in that queſtion, <hi>How can this bee?</hi> he is puniſhed with the loſſe of the uſe of his tongue, and ſpeech for a time. The rich gluttons tongue had denied <hi>Lazarus</hi> a crum, therfore it is denied a drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The ſame glutton had abuſed his tongue in gluttony and therfore his <hi>tongue</hi>
                        <pb n="273" facs="tcp:262:143"/> hath a peculiar torment in hell. So thoſe <hi>Zac.</hi> 14. 12. had their <hi>tougues</hi> conſumed in their <hi>mouthes,</hi> like enough as with their hand, ſo with their tongues they had fought againſt <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such was Gods Iuſtice upon <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> hee ſtretches forth his arme againſt the prophet, and the Lord withers it. He with his arme threatens to ſmite, &amp; God ſmites him in his arme. Like that juſtice which was done upon the Emperour <hi>Aurelianus,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 29.</note> who when he was ready to ſubſcribe, and ſet his hand to an Edict for the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Chriſtians, was ſuddenly cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in his knuckles, and ſo hindred from it by the judgement of God.</p>
                     <p>I may not here omit that notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Gods juſtice upon <hi>Rodolph,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suevia,</hi> he whom the Pope ſtirred up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his lawfull Lord and Soveraigne, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Oath to uſurpe his Crowne and Empire. This <hi>Rodolph</hi> in his wars for the Empire, was wounded in the right hand, of which wound he dyed, and at his death acknowledged Gods juſtice in theſe words; <hi>You ſee,</hi> ſaith he to his friends, <hi>here</hi>

                        <hi>my right hand wounded; with this right hand I ſware to my Lord</hi> Henry <hi>the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. But the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand of the Pope hath brought</hi>

                        <hi>me to this, that laying aſide the reſpect of mine Oath, I ſhould uſurpe an honour not due to me. But what is now come of it? In that hand which hath violated mine Oath, I am wounded to death.</hi> And ſo with anguiſh of heart he ended his dayes. An example ſo much the rather to bee marked, that men may ſee how God bleſſes the Popes bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, &amp; his diſpenſation with Oaths, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are given to arm men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt their lawfull Soveraignes.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The equity of Gods juſtice appeares in that, <hi>Pro.</hi> 26. 27. <hi>Who ſo diggeth a pit ſhall fall therein, and he that rolls a ſtone, it will returne upon him.</hi> Such was Gods juſtice upon <hi>Haman,</hi> he makes a gallowes for his owne necke. Hitherto wee may referre the juſtice of God, when God turnes mens beloved Sins into their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. Whoredome was the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites Concubines Sin: <hi>Iudges</hi> 19. 2. and Whoredome was her death, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. The Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 27. threatens the <hi>botch of Aegypt,</hi> and how frequently is the Sin of uncleannes ſmitten with the <hi>French botch,</hi> the fruit of the Sin? How frequent are the examples of Gods Iuſtice upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drunkards: drunkenneſſe their Sin, and drunkenneſſe their death. And ſo that Proverbe is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:262:144"/> verified, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>His owne iniquity ſhall take the wicked himſelfe, and he ſhall be holden with the cords of his Sins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The equity of Gods Iuſtice appeares in this, when he makes <hi>the place</hi> of ſin, <hi>the place</hi> of puniſhment. Wee have frequent examples of this in Scripture. This was threatned <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 21. 19. <hi>In the place</hi> where dogs licked the bloud of <hi>Naboth,</hi> ſhall dogs licke thy bloud. And this was made good, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 9. 26. In <hi>Tophet the place</hi> where they had ſlain their Sons &amp; Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, would God ſlay the <hi>Iews, Ier.</hi> 7. 31, 32. And as their <hi>houſes</hi> were the places of their <hi>ſins,</hi> ſo ſhould their <hi>houſes</hi> be the <hi>places</hi> of their puniſhment, <hi>Ier.</hi> 19. 13. And becauſe the Sabbath was prophaned <hi>in the gates</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> therefore in the gates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would God kindle a fire, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 17. 27. And remarkable is that, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>Their ſlaine men ſhall be amongſt their Idols round about their Altars, and under every thicke Oak,</hi> the place <hi>where they did offer ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to all their Idols.</hi> Such was the Iuſtice of God in that late blow upon the Popiſh company. In the very place where they uſed to diſhonour God, the hand of God was upon them, they were ſlaine, and their carcaſſes cruſhed in the place of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:262:145"/> their Maſs-worſhip, the firſt floore falling into their Maſſing place, &amp; ſo they &amp; their Crucifixes &amp; Images, all daſhed together, God doing with them as with the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Num.</hi> 33. 4. not only ſmiting them, but alſo <hi>executing judgment upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their gods:</hi> yea not onely ſo, but executed them and their gods, in the <hi>ſelf-ſame place,</hi> where God had been by them ſo much diſhonoured.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The equity of Gods juſtice is to be ſeen in <hi>the time</hi> of his puniſhments. God oft makes <hi>that time</hi> wherin men have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>the time</hi> of his judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. At the time of the Paſsover did the <hi>Iews</hi> crucifie <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and at the time of the Paſſeover was <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> taken. Heavie is the calamity that is befaln the Churches beyond the ſeas, the time wherein the firſt blow was given is not to be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The firſt blow was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sabbath, upon that day was <hi>Prague</hi> loſt. What one thing have all thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches fayled in more, than in that point of the religious obſervation of that day; that day they neglected to ſanctifie by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, upon that day God would be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his juſtice upon them, &amp; <hi>in the time</hi> would have them reade one cauſe of their puniſhment. Neither is the time wherein God did that late juſtjce upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe popiſh
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:262:145"/> perſons to be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is ſomwhat, that after their Roman accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it was upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their <hi>fift of Novemb. God</hi> would let thoſe of that Ieſuited brood ſee how good it was to blow up Parliament houſes, and happily would have them learne more loyalty and religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than to ſcoffe at our new holyday.</p>
                     <p>Of this kind was Gods juſtice upon one <hi>Leaver,</hi> who rayling on the worthy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr &amp; ſervant of Chriſt, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Latimer,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that he ſaw that evill favoured knave,</hi> Latimer, <hi>when hee was burned, and that hee had teeth like an Horſe,</hi> his Son the ſame houre, &amp; at the ſame time as neer as could be gathered, wickedly hanged himſelfe. And the ſame was Gods juſtice ſeazing upon <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> the ſame day that <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Latimer</hi> were burned.</p>
                     <p>Since then there is ſuch an equity in Gods adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of juſtice, let it be our care and wiſedome to obſerve the ſame. Learne to comment upon Gods works of Iuſtice, and to compare mens wayes, and Gods works together. God is to have the praiſe and glory of his juſtice upon others, as well as of his mercie to ourſelves, now we ſhal then be beſt able to give God this glory, when we ſo obſerve his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we may be able not only to ſay,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:262:146"/> The Lord is juſt, but the Lord is juſt in this, and that particular, when we can ſay, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 5. not only <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord that judgeſt,</hi> but righteous art thou O Lord that <hi>judgeſt thus. Thus</hi> they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and <hi>thus</hi> are they puniſhed. It is good to obſerve all the circumſtances of Gods juſtice, that ſo not onely the juſtice, but the wiſedome and equity of Gods juſtice may be ſeen; and this is to trace the Lord by the foot: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 24. Eſpecially wee ſhould be thus wiſe in perſonall evils that befall our ſelves, that by our puniſhment, and the circumſtances thereof, we might be led to the conſideration of our ſins, and ſo might ſay as <hi>Adonibesek; As I have don, ſo hath God rewarded me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Learne to give God the praiſe of his equity as of his juſtice. So doth <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 7. 15, 16, 17. <hi>I will praiſe the Lord</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>to his righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tremble and Sin not. Take heed how and wherein we Sin, leſt by our Sins wee teach God how to puniſh us. Take heed of abuſing thy to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue in ſwearing, rayling, ſcoffing, leſt God lay ſome terrible judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon thy tongue here, or ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t upon thy tongue in hel here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Take heed what meaſure thou mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureſt
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:262:146"/> to others, leſt thou teach God to meaſure the ſame to thy ſelfe. Take heed that thou make not thine houſe a den of ſpuing drunkards, leſt God make thine houſe to ſpue thee forth: Take heed how thou uſe thy wits, thy ſtrength; take heed of ſinning in thy Children, or any thing elſe thou haſt, leſt God make the matter of thy Sin the matter of thy puniſhment.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is not any one thing that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan the profeſſed enemie of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind labours, and endeauours more, then the hindrance of the ſaluation of man. There is but one way to Heauen, that which <hi>Peter</hi> cals the <hi>way of Truth,</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. which <hi>Salomon</hi> cals <hi>the way of good men, Prou.</hi> 2. 20. which <hi>Iſaie</hi> cals <hi>the way of Holineſſe, Iſai.</hi> 35. 8. which <hi>Ieremie</hi> cals <hi>the old, and the good way,</hi> and <hi>the ancient pathes, Ier.</hi> 6. 16. 18, 15. Now Sathan to
<pb facs="tcp:262:152"/> keepe men from Heauen, doth his vtmoſt to make men ſtumble at, and <hi>from the ancient pathes,</hi> that by taking offence at the waies of God, diſliking, and diſtaſting them, the ſaluation of their ſoules might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>To effect their ſtumbling at thoſe wayes Sathan layes many and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie kinds of ſtumbling blocks in the wayes of men. But yet amongſt thoſe many ones, I find there bee ſome more dangerous then others, and by which the Deuill preuayles much more then by the reſt. And thoſe I obſerue and conceiue to be ſpecially theſe three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Reproach, Contempt, and Obloquie, that by ſome men is vſually caſt vpon Religion and the conſcionable profeſſion, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours thereof. Sathan tels men that if they will needs goe this way they ſhall haue a deale of filth and dirt flung in the faces of them, that
<pb facs="tcp:262:153"/> they muſt looke to be ſcorned, and Reproached, as if they were the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Of ſcourings of the earth.</hi> And this very thing ſtarts and ſtumbles not a few. Some will better abide a ſtake, then ſome others can a mocke. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> could happily haue found in his heart to haue hearkened to the Prophets coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, but that this lay in the way, <hi>I am afraid of the Iewes, leaſt they deliuer me into the Caldaeans hands, and they mocke me, Ier.</hi> 38. 19. It was death to him to be mocked. But all conſidered, we ſhall ſee how little reaſon any haue for this to ſtumble at Religion. For doe but conſider who they are commonly that mock at Godlineſſe. Doe but obſerue their Character in the Scriptures, and you ſhall finde them ſuch as theſe. A company of Hypocrites. <hi>Hypocriticall mockers, Pſal.</hi> 35. 16. A crue of Drunkards, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 12. <hi>I am the ſong of Drunkards.</hi> A ſort

A company of <hi>Abiect perſons, Pſal.</hi> 35. 15. Like thoſe enemies, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 5. <hi>Lewd fellowes of the baſer ſort.</hi> A rout of prophane godleſſe irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Atheiſts that do no more know the Power, then Turkes, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens know the truth, of Godlines, <hi>The foole hath ſaid in his heart there is no God, you haue made</hi> a mocke <hi>at the counſell of the poore, becauſe the Lord is his truſt, Pſ.</hi> 14. 1. 6. It is a ſhrewd ſuſpition, that he that is a Mocker is an Atheiſt, It well ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him to mocke at Religion that denies a God, and it is a ſigne that he denies a God, that mockes at Godlineſſe, And will any wiſe man ſtumble at Religion for ſuch mens Mockes and Reproaches? What can be expected better from them? It was a good anſwere that that Oratour gaue <hi>Saluſt, Neque e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim</hi>

                     <hi>qui, ita vt tu, vixit, aliter quam tu loqui poteſt,</hi> It cannot be but that he that liues thy life, ſhould ſpeake thy language, and it is an anſwere will ſerue the turne in this caſe; To looke for other language from men of ſo ill lifes, were to expect to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grapes of thornes.

The greater, and richer ſort of the world they like not, nor look not this way, but onely a few of the lower ranke, and condition of men. And how euer many are ſtumbled at this, yet indeed little reaſon is there that any ſhould in ſuch a caſe be ſcandalized.

Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if men had but an eye of faith
<pb facs="tcp:262:156"/> in their heads. Carnal eyes that are dazeled with the glittering out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides of worldly glories are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at ſuch ſeeming baſeneſſe, but faith blindes it ſelfe againſt ſuch fleſhly Scandals, and will not ſee them, when it ſees them, but lookes thorough them, and ſees glory thorough them. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>And the word was made fleſh, and wee beheld his glory, as the glory of the onely begotten ſonne of the father,</hi> though his glory were obſcured with the vaile of the fleſh, yet this vaile hides not glory from the eye of faith, faith did looke thorough this vaile and eaſily diſcerned him the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp; onely begotten ſonne of the father, euen in the abaſement of his Incarnation. The wiſemen that came from the Eaſt, when they ſaw <hi>Herod</hi> at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> happily in all his royall Robes, yet fall not downe nor worſhip him; They come to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> and finde Chriſt in a
<pb facs="tcp:262:156"/> poore faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, happily in little better then rags, &amp; yet they fall downe &amp; worſhip him. Why fall they downe before a meane poore Chriſt, and not before a Magnificent, &amp; glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Herod?</hi> Why rather are they not ſcandalized at Chriſts baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and pouerty? This is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of faith, In Chriſts Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it ſaw Antiquity, in his baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe beauty, in his meanneſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and more glory in Chriſts rags, then in <hi>Herods</hi> Robes. So ſurely if men did liue and walke by faith, and not by ſight, neuer would Chriſt nor his Truth be ſtumbled at for the homely and poore out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of thoſe that profeſſe him. The purblind eye of fleſh cannot pierce through theſe vayles and cloudes, And what wonder is it to ſee a blinde man ſtumble?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But yet the ſoreſt and greateſt ſtumbling blocke of all, is the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſinnes and falles of ſuch as
<pb facs="tcp:262:157"/> profeſſe religion, certaine it is that theſe of all others are the moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous ſtumbling blockes by which Satan cauſes multitudes of men to ſtumble at religion, and workes them to the diſlike of the wayes of ſaluation. Afflictions and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions for the Goſpells ſake are dangerous ſtumbling blockes, and by reaſon of them many are ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at religion, as that they turne their backes vpon it, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 21. <hi>When tribulation, or perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſes becauſe of the word, by and by he is ſcandalized.</hi> So that Perſecutions cauſe Scandal. But yet the Scandals that come by the euill lifes of profeſſours are in ſome ſenſe farre more dangerous and hurtfull then thoſe ſcandals that come from Perſecutions. Though the ſcandal of perſecution ſtumble &amp; beate off many, yet haue very many beene gayned to a loue, and liking of Religion, by the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb facs="tcp:262:157"/> Courage, &amp; Conſtancy of the Saints of God in Perſecution. But neuer were, nor wilbe any gayned thereunto by the ſcandalous falles of profeſſours. Perſecutions keepe men off by feare, but Scandalous ſinnes by Hardening mens hearts. There is far more hope, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of gayning a man that is kept off by feare, then of ſuch as are kept off by a ſetled, reſolued Hardnes of Heart. In ſcandals of the Croſſe men may haue ſome ſecret likings of the Truth, may haue ſecret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in better times to owne it, but in ſcandals of euill example, men grow to an open, and profeſſed diſlike thereof. In ſcandals of the croſſe, there is not alwayes a diſlike of Religion it ſelfe, but onely of the hard termes, with which it muſt bee receiued, but from ſcandals of euill life growes a diſlike of Religion it ſelfe. Notwithſtanding the ſcandal of the croſſe men may haue an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,
<pb facs="tcp:262:158"/> and a good conceit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but ſcandals of euill life breede, and nouriſh a baſe and a vile eſteeme thereof in the hearts of men. So that perſecutions doe not doe that miſchiefe that ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous falles doe. <hi>Malicious perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours</hi> in ſome ſenſe doe not that hurt that <hi>ſcandalous profeſſours doe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſcandalous euents being ſo miſchieuous &amp; pernicious, and yet withall ſo common, &amp; ſo frequent, why may it not bee a worke of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to counterworke Satan, and to remoue out of the way theſe dangerous ſtumbling blockes, at which ſo many fall to their vtter ruine, and deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>As Satan <hi>Balaam-</hi>like <hi>caſts</hi> ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks in, ſo ſhould it be our care to <hi>take</hi> vp theſe ſtumbling blockes out of mens wayes.

It is Gods owne commandement we ſhould ſo doe, <hi>Iſay</hi> 57. 14. <hi>Take vp the ſtumbling blocke out of the way of my people.</hi> It were happy if wee could preuent ſcandals, but ſince that cannot bee <hi>(for it muſt needs be that offences come)</hi> the next happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is to preuent their miſchiefe, that though they doe come, yet they may come with as little hurt as may be. <note n="*" place="margin">

Secondly, by the abuſe or the vnſeaſonable vſe of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an libertie, of which kinde of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:262:163"/> the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 10. Thirdly, Scandal may be giuen by mens lifes, when their lifes and actions are ſuch as croſſe, and thwart the Religion profeſſed by vs, and diſhonours the Name of God, which we haue taken vp. As when a man profeſſes the Name &amp; Faith of Chriſt, and profeſſes it zealouſly, and yet fals into vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, drunkenneſſe, into groſſe and notorious acts of fraude and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenage, theſe bee ſcandals and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences becauſe they be occaſions to make others fall, they hinder ſome from comming towards goodneſſe and Religion, and they harden and confirme ſome in their ſinfull and euill courſes. Thus <hi>Dauids</hi> murther and adultery, <hi>Noahs</hi> drunkenneſſe, the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthians</hi> marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age were ſcandalous actions. Now though this text reach to offences of all kinds, yet I will onely med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with offences of this laſt kinde,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:262:164"/> ſuch as bee the groſſe and foule courſes and practices of any ſuch as haue taken vpon them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpell, and the Name of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>This Neceſſitie ariſes from a threefold ground:</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

God can gather grapes of theſe thiſtles, and figs of theſe thornes, and therefore his pleaſure it is, and ſo will he haue it that ſuch thornes, and thiſtles ſhould grow, and come vp in his garden. His wayes are not as our wayes, nor his thoughts as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:262:165"/> our thoughts. Hee can make that which for the preſent, and in our eye and apprehenſion is for the great diſhonour and diſgrace of his Name &amp; Truth, to turne at the laſt to the greater honour, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of both. Hee by his permiſſiue decree orders all ſuch ſcandalous euents to worke together to bring him in a great, and a rich returne of glory. Therefore, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 20. God is ſaid to lay a ſtumbling blocke before a man, <hi>And I lay a ſtumbling blocke before him.</hi> God hath decreed that there ſhall bee ſcandals. Not a Sparrow falls on the ground without our Father, <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 29. And therefore not a Profeſſour of his Name fals into ſcandal without him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hauing decreed that ſcandals ſhall be, there is a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the euent, It is impoſſible but that there ſhould be offences. But
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:262:166"/> yet this decree doth in no wiſe make God the authour of theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, becauſe his decree hath no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitating influence into the wils of men. It is a neceſſitie of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, and certaintie of the euent, but not a conſtraining, forcing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie to make them to doe that which ſhall giue ſcandal. Scandals ſhall neceſſarily, that is infallibly come to paſſe, but yet ſuch as giue ſcandal, ſhall not bee forced and neceſſarily conſtrained by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God to doe that they doe. They ſhall worke freely and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily in that which they doe, or elſe it were iniuſtice in God to bring a woe vpon him by whom an offence comes, if hee by a Superiour power from Heauen were forced and conſtrained to fall into ſcandal. What Gods holy ends are in that his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, wee ſhall ſee after in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:262:166"/> opening of the next point.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the malice of Sathan. The malice of the Deuill againſt Gods Truth, and Mans Saluation is exceeding great, and out of his malice againſt both, he endeuours nothing more then to make men ſinne. He goes about like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom hee may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure. But yet though all bee fiſh that comes to his net, yet his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall malice is againſt thoſe of Gods Church, and thoſe therein that moſt zealouſly profeſſe his Name and Truth. He knowes that if he can but draw ſuch into his nets and ſnares, and make them fall into fowle and ſcandalous actions, this will in a great meaſure diſhonour God and his Goſpell, diſgrace Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Godlineſſe, and ſtartle ſuch as are but looking towardes God, and wonderfully harden ſuch in their ſinfull wayes that are not ſo forward in the zealous profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:262:167"/> of the Goſpell, and therefore of all others hee hath ſuch in his eye, and vſes all his power and policie to enſnare and ſupplant ſuch more then a thouſand others. He had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther catch one fiſh then a thouſand frogs, rather fell one Cedar then a whole wood of ſhrubs. Satan ſees that the ſins and ſcandalous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſuch will bee exceeding ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantageous to the aduancement of his kingdome, and will conduce to the ſtrengthening of his partie more then the falls of any other. Therefore hee ſets vpon them with all his might and malice aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Thou art, ſay they of <hi>Dauid, worth ten thouſand of vs,</hi> And if the enemy had ſurprized <hi>Dauid,</hi> it had beene more aduantage to him then to haue ſurprized ten thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> So Sathan reckons one zealous Profeſſour of Religion if he can but entrap him worth ten thouſand others for his turne. Such
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:262:167"/> a mans fal would more blemiſh the Goſpell, and make men more ſtumble at Godlineſſe then if ten thouſand others ſhould do the like. Therefore liues hee by the King of <hi>Syria</hi> his principle, <hi>Fight neither againſt ſmall nor great, ſaue onely againſt the King of Iſrael,</hi> for let the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fall, and ſmall and great fall with him. His policie therefore is to aime and leuell eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at ſuch in whoſe fals hee may ruine many, and by whoſe ruines he may rayſe his owne kingdome. Other mens ſinnes worke nothing ſo much for his aduantage. <note n="a" place="margin">

Now the Deuill did what in him lay to keepe thoſe heathen from receiuing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and Chriſtian Religion, that by no meanes they might hearken to it.

Now haue the heathen occaſion to crie downe Chriſtian Religion, and to ſay, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold theſe be your Chriſtians that talke ſo much of holineſſe, where did they euer ſee any of vs whom they terme heathens to commit ſo fowle an act of Inceſt as to marrie his fathers wife.

This is your Chriſtian Religion, and theſe bee your Saints forſooth, now God bleſſe vs from ſuch a Religion, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer will wee be of ſuch a Religion. How much better is it to be honeſt heathens, nay, Adulterous forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Pagans then Inceſtuous Chriſtians? And thus queſtionles was many a Pagan mouth opened, and many an heathen heart ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, yea, many an one that before might be in ſome doubt of the euil condition of paganiſme was by this ſcandal kept off from looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſtian Religion. They li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not this Goſpell, and new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of theſe Chriſtians. Such mens ſcandals therefore being of ſo great aduantage for Satans pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and hee being ſo ſedulous and induſtrious to ſeeke and take all aduantages for his owne turne,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:262:169"/> hence it is that it cannot bee but that offences come.</p>
                     <p>How wel did Satan foreſee what he ſhould gaine by <hi>Dauids</hi> Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal?

How many men would thereby be ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Dauids</hi> zealous profeſſion? How many hearts bee thereby har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in their euil wayes?

But afterwards when <hi>Dauid</hi> came to be King, and liued in a full eſtate at his eaſe, then began hee to be more remiſſe, and therfore after his afternoones nap when hee was walking vpon the roofe, the Deuill ſets a ſnare, and his owne

And therefore there onely are ſcandals to bee found, where Religion and Godlineſſe are profeſt.

                     </p>
                     <p>Scandals and offences are diſmal and fatal to wicked men, becauſe God in his intention and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration diſpoſes and orders them
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:262:194"/> as the meanes that ſhall make way for the ſurer and ſorer puniſhment of them for their vnprofitableneſſe vnder, and their contempt of the Goſpell, the meanes of grace and the holy examples of ſuch as are truly godly. Therefore are they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and wofull euents becauſe they are ſent as executioners of diuine vengeance vpon the diſobedient rebels againſt the Goſpel. God giues men his word and the Miniſterie of it to conuert, and ſaue them, the holy examples of his children to guide, and lead them. Now neither one thing nor another will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime men of the world, nothing will doe them good, ſtill will they goe on in their vnbeliefe and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, notwithſtanding the light of the Word, and the light of holy examples, notwithſtanding the ſhining light of both, they will loue, and liue in darkneſſe ſtill. So then God ſeeing this that nothing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:262:195"/> will better them, but to Hell they will goe, and damned they will be, let his Miniſters, and his people do what they can, he thereupon enters into a reſolution to make ſure worke with them, and to take ſuch a courſe as ſhall infallibly, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuocably make way for their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ruine, and to this end in his prouidence diſpoſes of theſe ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous euents, as ſtumbling ſtones, and ſtumbling blockes; at which they may ſo ſtumble as they may fall, and be ſurely ruined. As if the Lord ſhould ſpeak on this manner. I haue giuen you my Word and Goſpel, it hath beene preacht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you plentifully, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, all the meanes notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, you haue not beene one whit the better, but rather worſe, yee are more ſtubborne, more rebellious, more malicious, and to Hell yee will, doe my Miniſters what they can.</p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:262:195"/>
                     <p> Well then ſince there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, ſince yee will goe, I will take an order to ſet you going ſurely. Behold, in my prouidence I will diſpoſe of ſcandalous euents to fall out that ſhall lie as ſtumbling blocks in your way; at which, ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yee, and fall yee, and be yee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſly ruined. I gaue you my word that you might haue riſen, but you would not be raiſed by it, I wil therfore lay a ſtumbling block in your way, at which you ſhall bee ſure to fall. I gaue you my word that you might haue liued, but now I will <hi>lay a ſtumbling blocke that you may die, Ezek.</hi> 3. 20. You would not bee drawne to Heauen by the holy examples and lifes of my Saints, therefore ſhall yee bee head-longed another way by the ſcandalous euents that ſhall by my prouidence fall out. I ſent my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, whom I made fiſhers of men, with their nets and baites to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:262:196"/> catch you, but by no meanes would yee bee caught in their nets, nor bite at their baites, nor bee catcht with their hookes, therefore now will I diſpoſe of ſcandalous euents, which I will ſet as traps, and ſnares and ginnes for you: greedily and eagerly ſhall you come to them, &amp; ſhalbe enſnared and held faſt for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer getting out againe. And thus doe ſcandals come as meſſengers of wrath and death.</p>
                     <p>Gods dealing with wicked men in euents of ſcandals, is cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his dealing with good men. Such as loue the truth of God, and ſubiect vnto it, though ſcandals come ſhall not bee enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them, God will ſecure and ſaue them from being enſnared, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 165. <hi>Great peace haue they which loue thy law, and nothing ſhall offend them,</hi> or, <hi>they ſhall haue no ſtumbling blocke.</hi> Such as loue Gods truth haue great peace, great
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:262:196"/> ſecuritie when ſcandals fall out, they ſhall haue no ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling blocks, God himſelfe will keepe them, that they ſhal not daſh their feet againſt theſe ſtones, they ſhall haue no ſtumbling blockes to hurt them. But now on the contrarie great danger and miſchiefe ſhall they haue that loue not the Law, they ſhall haue ſtumbling blockes, and therefore becauſe they loue not Gods law ſhal they haue them, that God may bee auenged vpon them for the neglect and contempt of his truth. And becauſe they loue not Gods Law, therefore ſhall ſcandals come, that ſhalbee fatal ſtumbling blocks for them. That looke as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſpeakes of the Harlot, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 26. <hi>I finde more bitter then death the woman whoſe heart is ſnares and nets, and her hands as bands, who ſo is good before God ſhall eſcape from her, but the ſinner ſhalbee taken by her;</hi> So may it be ſaid of ſcandals.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:262:197"/> 
                        <hi>Mare bitter then death,</hi> (woe vnto the world becauſe of ſcandals) are ſcandalous euents, <hi>for they are as ſnares and nets, who ſo is good before God,</hi> an holy and a godly man ſhal eſcape, and bee deliuered from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enſnared by them, <hi>but the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> the neglecter and contemner of Gods grace <hi>ſhall be taken,</hi> and bee ruined by them, and therefore woe vnto the ſinners of the world becauſe of ſcandals. It is in this caſe betweene men of the world and ſcandals, as it was in <hi>Ahabs</hi> caſe betweene him and his falſe prophets, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 22. 20, 21, 22. God had a purpoſe out of diuine Iuſtice and vengeance that <hi>Ahab</hi> ſhould <hi>fall,</hi> and bee ruined. Now God enters into counſell what courſe ſhall bee taken to bring it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that hee may fall and periſh, <hi>Verſe</hi> 20. <hi>Who ſhall perſwade</hi> Ahab <hi>that hee may goe vp</hi> and fall <hi>at Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth Gilead.</hi> There comes forth a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:262:197"/> ſpirit, <hi>Verſe</hi> 21. and ſayes, <hi>I will perſwade him.</hi> The Lord askes, <hi>Verſe</hi> 22. <hi>How</hi> or <hi>wherewith?</hi> Hee anſwers, <hi>I will goe forth and bee a lying ſpirit in the mouth of all his prophets.</hi> And the Lord ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt perſwade him and preuaile al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, Goe forth, and doe ſo.</hi> The caſe is the very ſame here. God beſtowes his Word, and the Miniſterie of it vpon a people, it workes them not to Faith &amp; Repentance. Hereupon is the Lord prouoked to anger, and vpon that hee enters into a conſult of reuenge. Here be a company of men that haue had the meanes of grace, but they will not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, and raiſed vp, I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolued they ſhall fall into Hell for euer. But who will now take ſome courſe that they may fal. Then ſteps forth Satan, I will take a courſe to make them fall fatally. And the Lord ſayes what courſe wilt thou take? Satan anſwers. I
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:262:198"/> will goe forth and draw ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Profeſſour of Religion into ſome groſſe and ſcandalous ſinne. And that ſcandal of his wil be ſuch a ſtumbling blocke at which they will ſo ſtumble, that I will warrant them fall farre enough, and deepe enough for euer recouering out of the pit. And the Lord anſweres, Thou ſhalt effect it and preuaile, Goe forth and doe ſo. Goe Satan, preuaile with ſuch, and ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour of Religion to bring him into ſome fowle ſcandal. And let that ſcandal bee a fatal ſtumbling blocke to make ſuch fall, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly periſh, that would not bee wrought vpon by the word.</p>
                     <p>So that looke what the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were to <hi>Ahab,</hi> that are ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals to the world, meanes of their fatall fals and ruines, woe to <hi>Ahab</hi> becauſe of the falſe prophets, and woe to the world becauſe of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals that make way for their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:262:198"/> as the falſe prophets did for <hi>Ahabs.</hi> So that by all this wee ſee that Gods diſpoſall of ſcandals, is an Act of diuine vengeance, and Iuſtice plaguing mens vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe vnder the meanes of grace, that by this meanes their righteous damnation might be ſealed vp, and made ſure.</p>
                     <p>And therefore this is a point well worth our obſeruation. That where God ſends moſt preaching, and the greateſt meanes of grace, there commonly fall out the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and fouleſt ſcandals, and where litle or no meanes, little or no ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal.</p>
                     <p>Now what may the reaſon of this bee? Not that the preaching of the Goſpel makes men worſe, as men of euil ſpirits are readie to ſlander and calumniate it in caſe of ſuch euents, but amongſt many other reaſons that might be giuen of it, this is one ſpeciall one. Where
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:262:199"/> God giues greateſt means of grace, and ſaluation, there mens ſinne in their vnprofitableneſſe, impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and vnbeliefe is the greater. The greater mens ſinnes are, the greater is Gods wrath, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of the greatneſſe of his wrath againſt mens great vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſſe, God diſpoſes it, that where the greateſt meanes of grace are neglected and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, there ſhall bee the greateſt ſcandals, that ſo hee may greatly plague great vnprofitableneſſe and contempt. God will haue ſuch as be vnprofitable vnder great means, to haue great fals, that they of all others may fall moſt lethally, and moſt dangerouſly, and fatally. Now a little ſtumbling ſtone cauſes but a little &amp; an eaſie fall, but the greater the ſtumbling block is, the greater, and more wofull muſt the fal needs bee. And therefore where greateſt meanes not profited by, are, there
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:262:199"/> are greateſt ſcandals to bring the greater woe, and vengeance vpon ſo great vnprofitableneſſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there the greateſt ſtumbling blockes to fall by, where the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt meanes to riſe by, that ſuch may not ſimply fall, but ſo fall that they may be daſht to peeces.</p>

                     <p>And that ſcandals, doe make men thus ſtumble at Religion, the word, &amp;c. how plaine doth dayly experience make it? let ſuch an one as profeſſes Chriſt, his word, his truth fall into any ſcandal, and what followes?

Are there any worſe then theſe, more diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and deceifull? If this be their religion, God bleſſe mee from their

                     <p>That ſcandals do bring this woe vpon the world, and proue ruining ſtumbling blockes thus to make them fall, is further cleere by that, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Yee are departed out of the way.</hi> It is a charge vpon the Prieſts. The <note n="u" place="margin">

A great deale of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe followed vpon it, namely, a <hi>woe,</hi> an heauie woe, vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:262:202"/> from their ſcandals. But what was that <hi>woe? Yee haue cauſed many</hi> to ſtumble <hi>at the Law,</hi> that, is to ſtumble at true religion, and the wayes of God. When the people ſaw the Prieſts that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and preacht the Law, and who ſo great Zelots for the Law as they, when they ſaw theſe Prieſts to liue ſo looſely, and ſo ſcandalouſly they began to ſtart at it, and to queſtion happily whether this Law, this religion they preached, and profeſſed were of God or no. And if this were their law, and their religion, for their parts they were reſolued neuer to haue to doe with ſuch a Law, with ſuch a religion Thus their ſcandals did ſtumble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> And thus did their ſcandals bring an heauie woe vpon the people, for what a woefull condition was this, thus to ſtumble at the Law, at the true religion of God? what was this, but to ſeale vp, and make ſure
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:262:203"/> their owne damnation? for if they would none of the Law, they could none of Heauen, if ſhut out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, what remayned but Hell? The Lord had, it is likely, a long while called vpon the people by his Prophets, they would not hearken nor repent, nor imbrace the truth of God. The Lord therefore in his Iuſtice reſolues to be reuenged vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, by bringing a woe vpon them. And what woe would God bring vpon them! This woe of ſtumbling at religion that ſo hee might make ſure worke with them, that ſince they would not be ſaued, when hee offred them ſaluation, therfore now they ſhould neuer be ſaued. But now what courſe will God take to effect this, and bring this woe vpon them. He will in his wiſe prouidence lay the ſtumbling blocke of the Prieſts ſcandals in their way, at which they ſhall ſo ſtumble as to diſlike the Law, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:262:203"/> to fall into an vtter diſtaſte of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by which they ſhould make ſure worke againſt their owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. And ſo woe was vnto the people from the Prieſts ſcandals.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Scandals make way for woe in that they make way to occaſion, men of the world to fall into the fowle and woefull ſinne of blaphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Gods holy Name. It is a <hi>woefull</hi> thing to fall into that ſinne, eſpecially ſo to fall into it, as to make that the ioy of our hearts which tends to the reproach and diſhonour of his Name. The Name of God is <hi>a glorious and a fearefull Name. Deut.</hi> 28. 50. and therefore how <hi>woefull and fearfull</hi> a thing for a man to blaſpheme that Name. What doth he better then cut him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe off, from all communion with God that blaſphemes his Name, that flies in his face, and triumphes in his reproach. It is ſaid of the malicious Iewes. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 45. that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:262:204"/> they ſpake againſt <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine <hi>contradicting, and blaſpheming.</hi> And marke what followes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 64. <hi>Seeing yee put the word of God from you, and iudge your ſelues vnworthy of euerlaſting life, loe we turne to the Gentiles.</hi> See then when they blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed what they did, They <hi>put away the word from them,</hi> they iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themſelues <hi>vnworthy of life,</hi> they cauſed God to <hi>turue away</hi> the meanes of ſaluation from them. Such a caſe is a woefull caſe, and to this caſe will contradicting &amp; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming of God, and his truth, and Religion bring men. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this regard are ſcandals wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full euents becauſe they occaſion men to blaſpheme and ſpeake euill of God and his truth. When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> fell into that foule Scandal, what followed vpon it? See 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>By this deede thou haſt giuen great occaſion to the enemies of God to blaſpheme.</hi> Thoſe amongſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:262:204"/> the people that were haters of true godlineſſe, and enemies to the powerfull profeſſion thereof and ſo enemies of God when <hi>Dauid</hi> fell into this ſinne, they fell into a <hi>woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> caſe, they preſently fall a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming of Religion, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euill of godlineſſe, and he that blaſphemes godlineſſe blaſphemes God, and ſo by this meanes cauſes God in wrath peremptorily to turne from them. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 23. 24. <hi>thorough you the name of God is blaſphemed amongſt the Gentiles.</hi> So that the ſcandalous ſinnes of the Iewes were ſtumbling blockes to the Gentiles that made them fall into that fowle ſin of blaſpheming, that muſt needes make them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of eternall life.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Scandals make way for woe, in that they make way for the hardning of the hearts, and ſtiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the neckes of ſinnefull men in their euill wayes. It is a very
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:262:205"/> dangerous thing, for a man to bee in a ſinnefull way, but for a man to haue his hand ſtrengthened in his Iniquity, to bee hardened in any ſinne, this is a woefull condition. It is the greateſt <hi>woe,</hi> and <hi>curſe</hi> that can be to haue ones hart hardened. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 64. 65. <hi>Render vnto them a recompence O Lord according to the worke of their hands, Giue them</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie <hi>of heart, thy</hi> curſe <hi>vnto them. Salomon</hi> ſpeakes of the <hi>plagues in the heart.</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 8. 38. The plague in the body, is a woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſeaſe, and what then is the plague in the heart. God threatens <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with this plague, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>I will at this time ſend all my</hi> plagues <hi>vpon thine heart,</hi> and ſee how God did it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 2. <hi>Goe into</hi> Pharaoh <hi>for I haue</hi> hardened <hi>his heart.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Hardnes,</hi> or <hi>Hardening</hi> of the heart is the <hi>plague</hi> of the heart. God ſent ten plagues vpon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:262:205"/> plague of his heart, in the harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, was ten times greater then all the plagues of Aegypt. It is that which vſually God premiſes, and fore-ſendes when hee meanes to prepare men to temporall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. When God meanes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, to ſpeede a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or a whole nation, and to bring ineuitable deſtruction vpon them, God firſt makes way for it, by the hardening of mens hearts. <hi>Exo.</hi> 14. 17. When God would get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe honour in the deſtruction of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians. I will ſaith hee,</hi> harden their hearts, <hi>and they ſhall follow them, and I will get me honour vpon Pharaoh.</hi> So <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 11. 19. 20. Not a City that made peace, with the children of <hi>Iſrael, ſaue the Hiuites the Inhabitants of Gibeon, They tooke all in battell.</hi> But why did not other Cities, doe as the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> why did not they ſubmit, and ſeeke their peace? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:262:206"/> God had a purpoſe, they ſhould bee deſtroyed, and to make the ſurer way for it, gaue them vp to an hardened heart, <hi>for it was of the Lord, to harden their hearts, that they ſhould come out againſt Iſrael in battell, that he might deſtroy them vtterly, and that they might haue no fauour but that hee might deſtroy them.</hi> So that when God meanes that a man ſhall haue <hi>no fauour,</hi> but be <hi>vtterly deſtroyed</hi> then God firſt giues men vp to <hi>hardneſſe</hi> of heart. Nay, it is that which is a <hi>woefull</hi> preparatiue to eternall wrath, it is that which lockes men, and ſhuts them faſt vp, and keepes them ſure for eternal vengeance. When God is ſo angrie, as that hee is peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily reſolued that a man ſhal not be ſaued, but bee damned without all peraduenture, then God giues him vp to the hardneſſe of heart, vnder which hee ſhall be ſurele re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued vnto the day of wrath.</p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:262:206"/>
                     <p> When a Prince is reſolued to put a man to death, he commands him firſt to bee ſurely impriſoned, to bee laid faſt in fetters and irons. When <hi>Herod</hi> meant to execute <hi>Peter,</hi> ſee what ſure worke is made, <hi>He is deliuered to foure quaternions, of Souldiers to bee kept,</hi> hee lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>two Souldiers, bound with two chaines, and the keepers before the doores keeping the priſon, Act.</hi> 12. 4. 6. So that in reaſon there was an impoſſibilitie of his eſcape from death.</p>
                     <p>So when God will make ſure worke with a man, and is peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie for his execution, the Lord deliuers him vp to hardneſſe of heart, and this hardneſſe of heart will be as <hi>quarternions of Souldiers,</hi> as <hi>Chaines,</hi> and <hi>Keepers,</hi> Lockes, Barres, Boults, and Fetters, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue a man ſure for damnation. A man hath had the meanes of grace offered him, he hath ſlighted them,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:262:207"/> and he will goe on, and he will doe this and that, ſay all the Preachers what they will, and can to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. When God ſees this, hee thus reſolues. Here is a man that I would haue ſaued, I offered him the outward meanes of grace, but he hath ſtubbornly and rebelliouſly ſtood out againſt the meanes, I am reſolued hee ſhall neuer be ſaued. I but perhaps the man liues ſtill vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the meanes of grace, and ſo long there is a poſſibilitie of his conuerſion, and if he be conuerted he muſt needs be ſaued. Therefore God to keepe him from ſaluation will take a courſe ſure enough to keepe him from conuerſion. Now what courſe is that? God will haue ſuch a mans heart hardened. And if once the heart be hardened there is no poſſibilitie of Conuerſion, &amp; is no Conuerſion, no Saluation. This proceſſe of Diuine Iuſtice &amp; vengeane wee haue. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Make</hi>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:262:207"/> 
                        <hi>the heart of this people fat, and make their eares heauie, and ſhut their eies leſt they ſee with their eyes, and heare with their eares, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand with their heart, and conuert and be healed.</hi> We ſee in the end of the Verſe, that Gods full and finall reſolution is that they ſhall <hi>not bee healed,</hi> that is, they ſhall not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as appeares, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4. 12. But how will God keepe them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaued, they hauing, and hearing the Word? They ſhall <hi>not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted.</hi> But how will he keepe them from Conuerſion? They <hi>ſhall not vnderſtand with their heart,</hi> though they heare. But how will hee keepe them from vnderſtanding with their heart? <hi>Goe make</hi> the heart <hi>of this people fat,</hi> that is, goe harden their hearts. When the heart is hardened they cannot vnderſtand with the heart, when they cannot vnderſtand with the heart, they cannot bee conuerted, when they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:262:208"/> cannot be conuerted, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaued. And ſo the hardening of the heart is nothing elſe but the locking, and the ſhutting, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a man vp, to keepe him ſure and faſt for Hell. So that for a man to bee giuen vp to hardneſſe of hearr is a ſigne, and a <hi>wofull</hi> ſigne that a man is ſuch an one, as on whoſe ſoule God is reſolued to ſhew no mercie, and that a man is in the wofull ſtate of reprobation. Therefore ſee how the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. <hi>Therefore hee hath mercie, on whom hee will haue mercie, and whom he will he hardens.</hi> See how <hi>hardenings,</hi> and <hi>ſhewing mercie</hi> ſtand in oppoſition. <hi>Whom he will he hardens,</hi> that is, he repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and ſhewes no mercie to. But why ſayes he not, to whom hee will ſhew no mercie, hee ſhewes none, but it ſteed of that, <hi>whom hee will hee hardens?</hi> Becauſe God makes way for the execution of his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:262:208"/> counſell of Reprobation by Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening mens hearts. By al this then it is cleere, that it is a <hi>woefull</hi> thing to bee giuen vp to the hardneſſe of heart, <hi>woe</hi> to that man that hath his heart hardened.</p>
                     <p>Now then Scandals are <hi>wofull</hi> euents vnto men of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be ſuch ſnares and ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks, as make and occaſion them to fall into this <hi>wofull</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hardening their hearts. Therefore <hi>woe to the world becauſe of ſcandals,</hi> becauſe by ſcandals their hearts ſhalbe hardened, they ſhall haue the wofull plague of the heart, they ſhall come vnder a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full curſe, be brought into a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue condition for temporall and eternall ruine. For when men ſee ſuch as make profeſſion of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to fall into ſcandals, and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous euils, it occaſions them excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to harden their hearts, and to bleſſe themſelues in their euill,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:262:209"/> &amp; vngodly wayes, as if their wayes were better then the wayes of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and their perſons in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtate and condition then theirs that make ſuch adoe with their profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Wee may conceiue the truth of this in the ſcandal of the Inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Corinthian, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. There were multitudes of Heathen Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians that had not yet receiued Chriſt, nor his Goſpel. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Corinthians had queſtionleſſe beene dealing with the Heathen Corinthians, to bring them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for the ſins of their Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliſme. What thoſe ſinnes were wee may ſee, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Neither fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, nor effeminate, &amp;c. nor Thieues, nor Couetous, nor Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, &amp;c. And</hi> ſuch <hi>were ſome of you.</hi> Namely, when they liued in their Heathen condition. Now out of theſe ſinnes would not the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:262:209"/> Heathen reſidue be brought. Now when all meanes, and endeauours for their reclaiming were in vaine, God in his Iuſtice would euen giue them vp to that wofull condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being hardened in thoſe their ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>To this end in his prouidence a ſcandalous euent is diſpoſed to come to paſſe in the ſinne of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous Corinthian, which could not but turne to the great harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Heathens heart in their ſinnes, Then began they to ſay and thinke in their hearts, They told vs our eſtates, and our wayes were dangerous and damnable, but to bee ſure, our wayes are as good as theirs. Wee are better yet then theſe profeſſours of Chriſt, we are honeſter at the hardeſt, then are they, The fornication and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is <hi>acted</hi> and committed amongſt them is not once <hi>named</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs.</p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:262:210"/>
                     <p> Wee will therefore euen keepe vs in theſe wayes, and goe on in theſe courſes ſtill. For if ſuch as theſe profeſſe themſelues to be, if your holy and ſtrict Chriſtians may doe ſuch vile things as theſe, then I trow it is not ſuch an hainous thing for vs that make no ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to bee Drunkards, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Swearers, &amp;c. And thus by occaſion of this ſcandal did they confirme, hearten, and harden themſelues in their iniquities. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any of the Chriſtians had after the falling out of this ſcandal, but offered to haue reproued an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Corinthian for Fornication, Drunkenneſſe, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what anſwere was he like to haue had but ſuch an one as this. Oh Sir, it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, you ſhould find fault with me, though now and then I may bee drunke, or commit fornication, yet I am not ſuch a beaſt, as ſuch an one your fellow Chriſtian, that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:262:210"/> made ſuch adoe with his holineſſe that hath now married his fathers Wife, I would you ſhould know it, I am as honeſt as he, and as good a liuer as hee for his heart. And ſo ſhooke they off all admonition and reproofe, &amp; hardened their hearts againſt all remedies by occaſion of that ſcandal. And ſo was there a <hi>woe</hi> to many an Heathen Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian, from the ſcandal of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous Chriſtian, becauſe they ſtumbled at it &amp; were enſnared by it, ſo as to harden the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in their ſinful courſes, &amp; ſo by that hardnes were ſealed vp to aſſured wrath.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing hardens men in their Iniquitie more, then to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie them in their ſinfull wayes. There is a Inſtification of a ſinner <hi>from</hi> his vngodlineſſe, and there is a Iuſtification of a ſinner <hi>in</hi> his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe.</p>

                        </hi> his ſins is called <hi>a Iuſtification of life, Rom.</hi> 5. 18. But Iuſtification of a ſinner <hi>in</hi> his ſins is a <hi>Iuſtification of death,</hi> that ſeales vp a man to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Iuſtification of a ſinner <hi>from</hi> ſin is an <hi>Act of Gods grace,</hi> &amp; mercy, and ſo hee iuſtifies the vngodly, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>on him that iuſtifies the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly)</hi> by acquitting, diſcharging, and abſoluing him from the guilt of his vngodlineſſe. Iuſtification of a ſinner in his ſin <hi>is an act of Gods wofull vengeance</hi> puniſhing men for former vngodlineſſe, and making way for the infallible aſcertaining of his damnation.

                        <hi>thy ſinnes, but thou haſt multiplied thine abominations more then they, and haſt iuſtified thy ſiſters in all their abominations which thou haſt done. Samaria</hi> was one of <hi>Iudahs</hi> ſiſters; The <hi>Samaritans</hi> were an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous wicked people, <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhee profeſſed her ſelfe the people of God.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:262:212"/> and by ſuch iuſtifying of her ſelfe, ſhe hardened and ſtrengthened her ſelfe in her ſinnes, and ſo were <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dahs</hi> ſcandals and abominations <hi>woefull</hi> euents to <hi>Samaria,</hi> becauſe thereby her heart was hardened to her deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>It is with ſcandals as it was with thoſe falſe Prophets, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 22. <hi>Yee ſtrengthened the hands of the wicked, that hee ſhould not returne from his wicked way.</hi> Men cannot bee ſaued if they bee not turned from their euill wayes, men cannot be turned from their euill wayes, if their hands bee ſtrengthened in them, and their hearts hardened. Now here was the miſchiefe and the woe that came by thoſe falſe Prophets, they ſtrengthened mens hands, and hardened their hearts in their euill wayes that they could not be ſaued. Such is the miſchiefe and the woe of ſcandals, men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ſaued, vnleſſe they returne

                     <p>Scandals are that to the World, that thoſe things were to the <hi>Iewes, Rom.</hi> 11. 9. <hi>Let their table bee made a ſnare, a trap, and a ſtumbling blocke, and a recompence vnto them.</hi> When no meanes of grace wil ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hard hearts and bring them to Repentance, God in his Iuſtice diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of ſcandals, and they are made ſnares, traps, and ſtumbling blockes, and a recompence vnto them that God may recompence them for their vnprofitablenes; and by thoſe ſcandals, occaſion them to harden their hearts to their ruine, that would not bee ſoftened vnto life.</p>
                     <p>It is otherwiſe to the World
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:262:213"/> from the ſcandals and fals of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, then it was to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> from the fall of the <hi>Iewes</hi> from Chriſt. The fall of the <hi>Iewes</hi> was for the happineſſe of the <hi>Gentiles. Rom.</hi> 11. 11. 12. <hi>Haue they ſtumbled that they ſhould fall?</hi> that is, fall quite and cleane off, <hi>God forbid, But through their fall, ſaluation is come vnto the Gentiles, The fall of them is the riches of the world.</hi> But now in ſcandalous fals of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors into foule ſinnes it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <hi>Thorough their fals damnation comes to many,</hi> and they are the miſchiefe, miſerie and vndoing of many. And that on this manner. God many times vouchſafes the meanes of grace and repentance to a people, in thoſe meanes ſtriues a long time with them, but ſtriues in vaine. Therefore he reſolues thus, My ſpirit ſhal ſtriue no longer with them, but ſince they will not, they ſhall not be ſaued, I will take a ſure
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:262:214"/> courſe for their damnation. I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued they ſhall not be ſaued, and becauſe they ſhalbee ſure neuer to bee ſaued, I will make ſure they ſhall neuer be conuerted, And that they may bee made ſure for euer being conuerted, I will take a courſe that they ſhall not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the word they heare with their hearts, and that they may not vnderſtand the word they heare, I will take a courſe for the hardening of their hearts, &amp; for the thorough hardening of their hearts ſome profeſſour of religion ſhall fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſcandal, and thereby ſhall their hearts bee hardened ſeuen fold more then euer, they ſhall iuſtifie themſelues in their ſinnes, and ſo by an hard heart ſhall put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues out of all poſſibilitie of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, and ſo out of all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of ſaluation. How often would I haue had you riſen, and yee would not riſe? therefore now
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:262:214"/> ſhall you fall into hell, <hi>for hee that hardens his heart ſhall fall into miſchiefe, Prou.</hi> 28. 14.</p>
                     <p>That therefore yee may fall into a miſchiefe, and with a miſchiefe; yee ſhalbe hardened, and that you may fall into greater hardnes of heart, ſome man ſhall fall into ſcandal; his fall into ſcandal ſhall make way for a <hi>woe</hi> to fall vpon your heads. His ſcandal ſhall harden you, that hardnes ſhall make you fall into miſchiefe. And thus woe to the world becauſe of offences, becauſe they come to ſtiffen, and harden their ſpirits, and as meſſengers of wrath to bind them ſure, hand and foote, that they may be prepared, to bee throwne out into vtter darkeneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>woe to the world, becauſe of offences,</hi> becauſe the world is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by them, to reiect the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing profeſſion of Religion, to fall fowle on Gods holy Name, to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:262:215"/> iuſtifie themſelues in their ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall wayes, and ſo by theſe things to make hell ſure their owne. So that the fall of a profeſſour of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is as the fall of an oake vpon vnderwood, and ſmaller trees, that be neere it: woe to them, when the oake fals, becauſe it miſchieues, bruſhes and breakes them in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by its fall. It is iuſt in this caſe, at it was in the ouerthrow of that Army. <hi>Ier.</hi> 46. 12. <hi>The mighty man hath ſtumbled againſt the mighty, &amp; they are both fallen together,</hi> firſt one fel; he being fallen, another ſtumbles at him, and ſo they both lay on the ground together. Thus falls it out in ſcandals. Firſt one falles into ſome great ſinne, others come and ſtumble at him being fallen, and ſo both fall, and the firſt mans fall is the laſt mans ruine. And therefore <hi>woe to the world becauſe of ſcandals.</hi>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:262:219"/> and I will ſhew you ſuch a ſight as you neuer ſaw. Look where that old Dotard lies drunke, and in what a baſe and ſhamefull faſhion? This is he that alwayes telling me of my ſwearing, cenſuring mee for my want of religion, this is hee that was ſo holy, ſo full of his religion, and godlines, ſee there how like a beaſt he lies. And ſurely if <hi>Canaan</hi> did tell <hi>Cham</hi> of it, <hi>Chams</hi> fact was exceeding vnnaturally villanous. the text ſayes. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>And</hi> Cham <hi>the father of</hi> Canaan <hi>ſaw the nakednes of his father,</hi> not occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and at vnawares, ſo might <hi>Shem,</hi> or <hi>Iaphet</hi> haue done.

And euery whit, as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cauſe hath the world to reioyce when ſcandals come, for then <hi>woe</hi> comes, God is ſetting his ginnes, and ſnares, &amp; traps to catch ſome, hee ſends forth his meſſengers of wrath, to doe ſeuere Iuſtice vpon perſons that haue beene vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnder the Goſpell.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:262:221"/> becauſe it came to be diſmall, and fatal, becauſe it was a meſſenger of wrath and vengeance. And why then make men mirth at ſcandals when they come?

                        <hi>he ſtumbles.</hi> If a man haue an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie that hates him, if any croſſe or calamity befalls him a man may not reioyce at it, nor bee glad of it not onely when he <hi>falles,</hi> and God vtterly ruines him, but if he doe but <hi>ſtumble,</hi> and God lay but ſome ſmaller croſſe vpon him. Now marke the reaſon, <hi>leaſt the Lord ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and he turne away his wrath from him,</hi> and ſo turne it vpon thee. So that the ſumme of the reaſon is, leaſt God ſhould bee angry, and his wrath ſhould be againſt thee. Marke then; If I may not reioyce at a mans <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtumbling and fall,</hi> then how much leſſe may I reioyce in a <hi>mans ſpirituall ſtumbling and falling,</hi> how much more will that diſpleaſe and anger God? If I may not reioyce at his outward fall leaſt God <hi>ſhould</hi> be angrie, then much leſſe when in another mans ſpirituall ſtumbling and fall God <hi>is</hi> angrie with mee,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:262:222"/> and out of his anger againſt mee diſpoſes his fall. Little cauſe haue I to reioyce at anothers ſtumbling and falling, when God in wrath diſpoſes of another mans ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make mee ſtumble, and of another mans fall to make me fall. What cauſe haue I to reioyce at his ſtumbling &amp; falling, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtumbles and fals that I may ſtumble and fall at him. And thus is the very caſe here. Such as doe giue ſcandals <hi>doe ſtumble</hi> that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>may ſtumble</hi> at them, <hi>doe</hi> fall that others <hi>may</hi> fall at them, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 64. 12. <hi>The mightie man hath ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled againſt the mightie: and they are both fallen together.</hi> It is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Egyptians ruined in war. It may bee that one Captaine that hated his fellow might ſee him fall by the ſword of the enemie. Now though he were his enemie that he ſee fall, had he any cauſe to reioyce? Not any at all. Why ſo? Becauſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:262:222"/> Gods prouidence diſpoſed that the fall of the firſt ſhould make way for the fall and ruine of the next. Hee that fell firſt ſhoud lie in his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes way as a ſtumbling blocke at which hee ſhould ſtumble and fall alſo. Thus we ſaw before that the fals of ſuch as profeſſe Religion, are but as ſtumbling blockes in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens wayes to precipitate them into ruine. And iudge then what cauſe they haue to reioyce thereat. If a man ſhould ſee a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſtone, or a ſtumbling blocke laid on purpoſe at a pits brinke to topple him headlong ouer into the pit, would that man reioyce that that blocke were laid there? I thinke not. This is the caſe here. Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals are <hi>ſtumbling blockes</hi> laide at hell pits mouth to precipitate, and head-long worldly wicked men downe into hell. So that to reioyce at ſcandals is to reioyce at the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and inſtrument of their owne
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:262:223"/> ſorrow to reioyce at that which will ſurely ſend them to Hell. Hee that reioyces in ſuch a caſe, Much good may his ioy doe him, I enuie no man ſuch ioy.</p>
                     <p>There fell out a ſcandal in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> 5. Now whereas vpon the euent of it they ſhould haue beene mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and heauie, they were in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other veine, <hi>Verſe</hi> 2. 6. They were <hi>glorying,</hi> and <hi>reioycing.</hi> They did not reioyce <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>at</hi> the ſcandal, that ſuch a man that made ſuch a profeſſion was fallen, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced in their owne gifts, in the gifts of their Preachers. What Church had ſuch Preachers, what people had ſuch gifts? And reioyce they might in theſe things, but now it was vnſeaſonable, they ſhould now rather haue beene mourning, becauſe of this ſcandal. Therefore the Apoſtle ſharply takes them vp, <hi>Verſe</hi> 2, 6. <hi>And ye are puffed vp, and</hi>
                        <pb n="125" facs="tcp:262:223"/> 
                        <hi>haue not rather mourned, your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, or reioycing is not good.</hi> If then the Apoſtle reprooues them thus for reioycing when there was a ſcandal, though they reioiced not at the ſcandal, how much more vehemently, and ſharply would he haue reprooued them if they had reioyced at, and for the ſcandal? How much more in this caſe would he haue ſaid, <hi>your reioycing is not good. Woe</hi> to the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſcandals, and yet many make theſe matters of <hi>woe</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters, but <hi>woe</hi> vnto them that in ſuch a cauſe laugh, for they ſhall weepe, and after-time, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-wit will teach them, that neuer had they greater cauſe of weeping, then euen then when they were vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their merry pinnes, becauſe that at which they made themſelues ſo merry, came with a woe vnto them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, this lets vs ſee
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:262:224"/> what great cauſe of feare, warines, and caution there is in caſe of ſcandalous euents. Since they bee ſuch dangerous euents, let men haue a ſpeciall care they be not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared, and entrapped by them. When ſcandals fall out, wee ſee there is a trap, and a ſnare ſet, there is a ſtumbling block laid, therefore it ſhould bee a mans wiſdome, and watchfulnes that he be not caught in the trap, that he be not enſnared in the gin, that he ſtumble and fall not at the block. We ſee that God hath put that wiſdome, warineſſe, and ſhineſſe into ſome creatures, that if a trap, or a ſnare bee ſet for them, they are very ſhie, &amp; iealous of comming neere it, or medling with the baite, and out of a feare of being taken, they will decline and ſhunne the ſnare, though tempted and allured thereto by ſuch baites as otherwiſe they haue a full good minde vnto. Such, much more
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:262:224"/> ſhould bee the ſhineſſe, and wary iealouſie of men in the caſe of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous euents. Doe wee ſee at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time ſuch as profeſſe religion to fall into any fowle enils, then thinke thus with thy ſelfe. I had thought that when ſuch euents had come to paſſe, the danger of them had beene onely a perſonall danger to the partie Delinquent, that it had beene onely for the diſcouerſe, and for the diſgrace of him, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dreamt of any further matter, and therefore I thought I might haue made a may-game of them, and haue reioyced and triumphed in their fals. But now I ſee there is a further matter in them then I was aware of, I ſee that they come to paſſe by Diuine Prouidence, to bring a <hi>woe</hi> vpon other mens heads. I ſee they come, that ſome may bee occaſioned to ſtumble at Religion, at the Law, at the Word, and from the ancient pathes, that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:262:225"/> hereupon they ſhould reſoluedly reiect &amp; renounce ſauing Religion, and the ſauing powerful profeſſion thereof to their owne aſſured ruine for euer. I ſee now that they bee diſpoſed by a Diuine Prouidence, that ſome men being occaſioned to blaſpheme Gods Name, &amp; Truth, may feele the weight of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging hand. I now ſee there is a Diuine finger in them, and that they come to occaſion ſome men to harden their hearts ſo, as they may fall into miſcheife; and be put out of poſſibilitie, and the reach of mercie. Theſe bee great dangers and heauie <hi>woes,</hi> for I ſee now they be but ſtumbling blockes, at which ſome men ſhall breake their neckes into Hell. I confeſſe, I did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer conceiue them to bee halfe ſo dangerous euents, I neuer appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended them ſuch dangerous traps and ſnares, as now vpon the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this point I ſee they are.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:262:225"/> Belieue it, I ſee it is good wiſdome in ſuch euents to looke about mee, and to take heed how I come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach of theſe ſnares.</p>
                     <p>Since Diuine Prouidence ſets them to make way for Diuine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, though ſuch a man profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing religion, haue committed a foule ſcandal, <note n="c" place="margin">

                     <p>Becauſe ſcandalous euents are dangerous euents, this ſhould bee therefore our wiſdome, warineſſe, and caution when they happen.

Woe vnto him by whom the offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. God threatens <hi>Eli</hi> very ſharply, <hi>I haue told him that I will iudge his houſe for euer,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. But why would God deale ſo ſeuerely? <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſay ſome Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations) <hi>his ſonnes runne into a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, and he reſtrained them not,</hi> or <hi>frowned not vpon them.</hi> If God would puniſh <hi>Eli</hi> for not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcandals, how much more will he puniſh them that giue ſcandals. The practices of <hi>Elies</hi> ſonnes were monſtrous ſcandalous, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 22. and what did they by ſo doing? <hi>Becauſe his ſonnes bringing a</hi> curſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:262:230"/> 
                        <hi>vpon themſelues,</hi> So <hi>Iunius.</hi> So that by thoſe Scandals they brought a <hi>curſe</hi> vpon themſelues, A <hi>woe</hi> came vpon them by their ſcandal.</p>
                     <p>The woe that purſues ſuch is threefold. Firſt, <hi>Temporall.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Spirituall.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>An eternall woe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. God will purſue ſuch with <hi>temporall woes.</hi> And they are theſe three.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. With a <hi>woe</hi> vpon them in their <hi>Name.</hi> A good Name is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding pretious. For the worth and value of it preferred before <hi>Siluer, Gold, and great riches, Prou.</hi> 22. 1. For the ſweetnes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and contentment of it before <hi>ſweet oyntment, Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 2. So that for a man to looſe his good Name, is as great a loſſe as to looſe a great eſtate of great riches. It would bee iudged a <hi>woefull</hi> condition for a man that had a great eſtate, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of wealth, if Gods hand
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:262:230"/> ſhould follow him, and conſume him, and bring him to nothing. It is no leſſe a wo to be bereft of ones good Name, and to haue the ſmell of that ointment taken away. Now in this thing is there a woe to him by whom an offence and a ſcandal commeth. Not onely the ſweetnes of this ointment is taken away, but that ſweetneſſe is turned into a loathſome and a noyſome ſauour, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>Dead flyes cauſe the ointment of the Apothecarie to ſend forth a ſtinking ſauour, ſo doth a little folly him that is in reputation, for wiſdome and honour.</hi> Let a man haue the honourable name of a wiſeman, yea, of a godly, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, zealous man, which giue the greateſt honour in the world to a man, yet, if he bee guiltie but of a <hi>little folly,</hi> that little folly impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches his Name, as much as a <hi>dead flie</hi> will do a boxe of ointment. Let ointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be neuer ſo ſweet &amp; good,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:262:231"/> yet if but a <hi>dead flie,</hi> or two bee in it, they doe not onely take away the <hi>ſweetneſſe of the ointment,</hi> but cauſe it to ſtinke, and to haue a vile fauour, ſo that a man will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not ſmell to it, but ſtops his noſe at it.</p>
                     <p>Now if a <hi>dead flie</hi> will doe ſo much in a boxe of ointment, what will a <hi>dead dogge,</hi> or ſome ſuch fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy carrion doe? If a <hi>little folly</hi> will ſtaine a mans reputation what will a <hi>great</hi> deale doe? Specially when it is <hi>folly</hi> in a high nature, not <hi>folly</hi> ſlipt into at vnawares, but artificiall, and deliberate <hi>folly, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> lyen in and practiced a long while, how much more will that ſtaine, &amp; make a mans name ſtinke? That ſame ſpeech of <hi>Thamars</hi> (but that Luſt hath no eares) had a great deale of weight in it, when <hi>Amnon</hi> was bent vpon the commiſſion of a foule ſcandalous fact, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 13. <hi>And as for thee thou ſhalt be as one of</hi>

                        <hi>the Fooles in Iſrael.</hi> Indeed that had beene enough to haue ſtayed him, if his Luſt would haue giuen him the libertie of deliberation. It was as if ſhe had ſaid. If thou doeſt this thing, <hi>woe</hi> bee vnto thee. But what <hi>woe?</hi> Now thou art a man of ſome credite and eſteeme, but if thou doe this ſcandalous Act, God wil blaſt thy name and credit, <hi>Thou ſhalt be as one of the Fooles of Iſrael.</hi> This is the iuſt hand of God vpon ſuch, that they ſhalbe ſmitten with the loſſe of their credit and Name, and bee counted of the number of the Fooles in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> It is a vile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to be a Foole any where, but to be a <hi>Foole in Iſrael,</hi> to be of vile, and baſe report, and repute in the Church of God, this is an heauie puniſhment. <hi>Amnon</hi> was afterward ſtabd by <hi>Abſoloms</hi> Seruants, had <hi>Amnon</hi> had but any ſenſe left after that ſinne of his, the Sword of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoloms</hi> Seruants could not bee ſo
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:262:232"/> cutting, and ſo piercing, as was this, There goes <hi>Amnon</hi> that baſe man, that vile perſon, There goes one of <hi>the Fooles in Iſrael.</hi> When <hi>Amnon</hi> could not ſtirre, nor bee ſeene in the ſtreets, could not bee occaſionally mentioned in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie talke, but one or other would bee throwing the myre of his baſe action in his face, and the mention of him had beene as the ſtirring of an vnſauourie excrement, What He? Ah vile man, ah wretched fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; Why, theſe things were farre more keene and cutting, then the very Swords that murthered him.</p>
                     <p>Wee may ſee the truth of this, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 8, 9. The Prieſts were ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, and by their ſcandalous courſes had cauſed many to <hi>ſtumble at the Law.</hi> Well <hi>woe</hi> bee to them, God would meet with them for it. What <hi>woe</hi> doth God bring vpon them? <hi>Therefore haue I alſo made you contemptible, and baſe before all</hi>

                        <hi>the people.</hi> God brought a <hi>woe</hi> vpon them in their credit and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme, that they were vile in the eſteeme of all, one and another, good and bad. And herein the Lord ſerues men but iuſtly, and payes them with their owne coine, By ſcandals Gods Name is defiled, Gods Name diſgraced, &amp; blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, therefore for their ſcandals God ſmites them in their Names, that in the <hi>woe</hi> lighting vpon their Names, they may ſee what it was to diſhonour, &amp; pollute the Name of God; God will pollute their Names that pollute his, and will cauſe that pearle of theirs to bee trod in the dirt, and mire. Yea, God ſo takes to heart the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Name by ſcandals, that though there may bee true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet ſtill ſome ſtaine may lie vpon the Name. <hi>Dauid</hi> made his peace with God, and truly repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo as the Prophet tels him his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:262:233"/> ſinne was forgiuen him, and yet 1. <hi>King.</hi> 15. 5. after <hi>Dauid</hi> is dead and gone, that fact of his is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as ſome blurre. <hi>Dauid did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, ſaue onely in the matter of</hi> V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah <hi>the Hittite. Dauid</hi> did other things that were ſinfull, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of the people, the giuing of <hi>Mephiboſheths</hi> Lands to <hi>Ziba,</hi> why then ſayes the text, <hi>ſaue in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Vriah?</hi> Becauſe though the other were <hi>ſinnes,</hi> yet they were not <hi>ſcandalous ſinnes.</hi> The other was a ſcandalous ſinne, and a ſcandalous ſin is of that heynous nature, that though the guilt be taken away, yet after the wound hath done blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and is cloſed vp, and healed, there will remaine ſome skarre in the Name, and credit. So that of foule ſcandalous offenders it may be ſaid as of the Adulterer, <hi>Prou.</hi> 6 33. <hi>A wound, and diſhonour ſhall he get, and his reproach ſhall not be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi>

                        <hi>away.</hi> So long as hee liues his reproach will liue with him, yea and out-liue him too, his reproach will laſt as long as his memoriall. And as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> is ſeldome named in Scripture without diſhonour, <hi>Ieroboam that made Iſrael to ſinne,</hi> ſo ſuch ſeldome be mentioned, but with the remembrance of their ſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, oh that was he that made ſuch a profeſſion of Religion, and yet playde that heynous pranke. Wee haue a cauſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 9, 10. that when a man refuſed to doe a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers office, his brothers wife muſt <hi>looſe his ſhooe from off his foot, and ſpit in his face, And his name ſhall bee called in Iſrael the houſe of him that hath his ſhooe looſed.</hi> Now all this was great diſgrace, and matter of great reproach, But what was this to the reproach that comes by a ſcandal? How much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is it to haue all men readie to ſpit in ones face, to haue it ſaid,

                        <hi>the houſe of him</hi> that had his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>looſed,</hi> the man who deſerued to haue <hi>his face ſpit in,</hi> becauſe hee occaſioned ſo many to ſpit on, and ſpit at religion and the Goſpell.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A <hi>ſecond temporall woe</hi> which God will bring vpon them, and followes vpon the former is <hi>eiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>caſting</hi> of them out of the <hi>ſociety</hi> &amp; <hi>communion</hi> of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

They are like a <hi>broken veſſell.</hi> A veſſell whileſt it is whole is vſefull, and deſireable, and whileſt whole, vſe is continually made of it, it is called for, enquired for, and is at euery turne in requeſt. But now let ſuch a veſſell bee broken, it is thrown by, throwne out of doores, caſt on the dunghill, none once meddles with it, nor lookes after it. So whileſt ſuch perſons are whole veſſels, they are veſſels of vſe, and honour they haue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of communion and ſociety,

It was ſcandalous to haue done ſo vnclean an act in any place, but to doe it in a ſcared place with women com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither vpon deuotion, this was egregiouſly ſcandalous. God therefore takes them to doe, and does execution vpon them, and cuts them both off in one day by the Sword of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> God
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:262:240"/> brought the <hi>wo</hi> of the Sword vpon them.

If it goe thus hard with <hi>Eli</hi> that reſtraines not, how hard will it goe with <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas</hi> that commit the ſcandal?</p>
                     <p>Wee cannot haue a more preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and full example in this kinde, then <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe.

Firſt, God ſmites his childe with death, then followes his daughter <hi>Thamars</hi> defilement by her brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> then <hi>Amnons</hi> murder, then the treaſon of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> in which the hand of God was exceeding ſmart, God turnes him out of houſe and home. Whoſe heart would not earne, and bleede to ſee his dolefull departure from Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, 2. <hi>Sam</hi> 15. 30. <hi>And Dauid went vp by the aſcent of mount Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet, and wept as he went vp, and had his head couered, and hee went bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote, and all the people that was with him couered euery man his head and they went vp weeping, as they went vp.</hi> Who could haue beheld ſo ſad and ſo woefull a ſpectacle with drie eyes? But this was not all, his life is endangered, his Concubines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed in open view on the houſe top. And what thinke wee was the ground of all this? For the childs
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:262:241"/> death we ſee, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13, 14. <hi>The Lord hath put away thy ſinne, thou ſhalt not die, howbeit becauſe by this thy deede thou haſt giuen great occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme the child alſo that is borne vnto thee ſhall ſurely die.</hi> It is verie much that faſting and praying can doe, it can caſt out deuils, <hi>This kind goes not out but by faſting and praying, Mark.</hi> 9. 29. And yet faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying could not keepe off this <hi>woe</hi> that <hi>Dauids</hi> ſcandal brings vpon him in the childes death, <hi>woe</hi> vnto <hi>Dauid by whom</hi> that <hi>offence came,</hi> therefore ſhall his childe die. And for all the reſt of all thoſe wofull ſorrowes 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 9. 10. 11. 12. we ſee the cauſe of them all, theſe woes were vpon <hi>Dauid</hi> for his ſcandal. And if Gods woe in theſe temporall, &amp; outward calamities will thus purſue and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, &amp; an humbled ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous offender, how much more

If <hi>Dauid</hi> the man after Gods owne heart muſt not eſcape, what then ſhall others looke for?

And thus <hi>temporall woe</hi> is to him <hi>by whom offences come.</hi>

Thus God would make his ſoule ſmart, and his heart ake for this ſcandal of his, would make him feele the truth of Chriſts ſaying, <hi>woe vnto him by whom the offence comes.</hi> It was <hi>Dauids</hi> caſe before him. When hee had fallen into ſcandal, in the matter of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and <hi>Vriah,</hi> before hee comes to a redintegration of his former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, God brings him vpon the racke. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51. 12. <hi>Reſtore vnto me the ioy of thy ſaluation,</hi> therefore that was taken away &amp; gone, that ſweet ſunſhine was ouerclouded, yea that ſunne was dreadfully eclipſed, and how fearefull ſuch eclipſes be, they

                     <p>Other men ſinne in thoſe euils which they commit, but yet this ſinne they are not guiltie of. They onely commit the ſinne of polluting Gods Name, that doe profeſſe his Name. This is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Church-ſinne, and befals not ſuch as are without. When men take the Name of God, and the profeſſion of Religion vpon them, and yet liue lewdly and looſely, or fall into any ſcandalous practices, they doe thereby defile the Name of God, and pollute it. Wee finde the people charged with this ſinne, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 20. <hi>That they prophaned</hi> or <hi>polluted Gods holy Name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Heathen whither they went.</hi> Now how could they pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Gods Name?

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:262:247"/> Verſe. <hi>They prophaned my Name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Heathen when they ſaid of them, Theſe are the people of the Lord, and are gone out of his Land.</hi> The <hi>Iewes</hi> where euer they came profeſſed themſelues the people of God; that they had the God of Heauen for their God, and that they had his Law, and Oracles, and that they were an holy people, neer vnto him, hereupon the Heathen looked for ſome ſingular thing from them, ſingular holineſſe in their lifes, ſingular fidelitie in their dealings, &amp;c. But when they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued their lifes, many of them to bee looſe and ſcandalous, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne preſently to open their mouthes againſt God, and againſt his Truth, oh <hi>theſe bee the people of the Lord,</hi> theſe be your holy people, that worſhip ſuch an holy God, that haue ſuch an holy Law. No maruell their God, their Law, their Religion is ſo holy, for ought wee
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:262:248"/> fee by theſe mens lifes, there is no more in their God, and Religion then in ours. Thus ſpake the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then when they ſaw the wicked lifes and practices of ſome of the people of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> And indeede it is an Heatheniſh tricke in ſuch caſes to fall foule vpon God and Religion, It is heatheniſh language to ſay, <hi>Theſe bee the people of the Lord,</hi> and this is their religion and their zeale.</p>
                     <p>And thus by their euill lifes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioning the heathen to blaſpheme God, and to throw the filth of their baſe actions vpon Him and his Name, they thereby polluted his Name.</p>
                     <p>Thus was Gods Name polluted by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> among the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> When they firſt came amongſt the Weſt <hi>Indians,</hi> the people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them whence they came, and what they were?

When men doe pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Gods Name, God who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes readie to vindicate his owne

                     <p>That paſſage is worthy our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 20. 23. <hi>When they entred vnto the Heathen whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they went, they prophaned mine holy Name: And I will</hi> ſanctifie <hi>my great Name which was prophaned amongſt the Heathen, which they haue profaned in the middeſt of them, and the Heathen ſhall know that I am the Lord, ſaith the Lord God, when I ſhall bee</hi> ſanctified <hi>in you before their eyes.</hi> See then that God will ſanctifie his Name when men pollute it, and hee will one way or other take order to waſh off that pollution, wherewith men haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed it. God would be ſanctified in them before the eyes of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>
                     <p>Now Gods Name is ſometimes

Now though in that forenamed place it is ſpoken of ſanctifying his polluted Name by his workes of Mercie in the eyes of enemies, yet it is alſo true that God wil ſanctifie his polluted Name in the eyes of Aduerſaries by his workes of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, That is, hee will doe ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarie Iuſtice, and ſuch ſmart <hi>woe</hi> vpon ſuch as by their ſcandals polluted his Name, that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer himſelfe as much glorie in their puniſhment as they loſt him by their ſinne, and ſo remarkeably will he doe it in enemies eyes, that they who before opened their mouthes to diſhonour his Truth, ſhall now open their mouthes to acknowledge his glorious Iuſtice, and by that Iuſtice bee drawne at leaſt to a ſecret acknowledgement, that this Religion and this profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

A foſtered and a cheriſht luſt doth exceedingly endanger a man, puts him into great danger of falling into ſcandal. Let a luſt be loued, and cheriſhed and it will ſo befoole, and bewitch a man that hee will maintayne, and ſockle it though it be with the hazard of the credit of Religion, and the Goſpell, it will grow ſo ſtrong at the laſt that it will headlong him into ſome ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal or other. Therefore deale ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely with theſe luſts, that will bring thee happily to doe that which will cauſe God to deale ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely with thee, be ſure to make ſure worke with them by mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is a good way to preſerue thee from ſcandal. This is the very courſe our Sauiour here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes. Hauing in this ſeauenth verſe ſhewed the woe that falles vpon the giuers of ſcandals, ſee what he inferres, <hi>Verſe.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>

                        <hi>if thine hand; or thy foote offend thee cut them off, and caſt them from thee, &amp;c. And if thine eye offend thee plucke it out, and caſt it from thee. &amp;c.</hi> Marke then what it is that makes men offend. Namely mens luſts, <hi>their right hands, eyes, feete.</hi> Theſe bee the ſcandal-bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. If a man would bee free from giuing of offence he muſt <hi>out,</hi> &amp; <hi>off</hi> with that which <hi>cauſes</hi> him to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende. Now luſts when they are made much of, when they be made deere, <hi>hands,</hi> and <hi>eyes,</hi> and <hi>right eyes,</hi> aſſuredly they will <hi>cauſe men to offend.</hi> Therefore the way to ſaue our ſelues that they cauſe not vs to offend, is to offend them, the way is by mortification to <hi>cut off,</hi> and <hi>caſt away,</hi> ſuch hands, feete, and eyes as will cauſe vs to offend. Were but this done how happily might many fowle ſcandals be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented? <hi>If Dauid</hi> had preſently <hi>pluckt out</hi> his wanton eye, and caſt
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:262:273"/> it away; how eaſily had hee beene ſecured from that great offence hee gaue?</p>
                     <p>It may be many a man out of the great pride of his heart, and his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant ſelfe-loue makes his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and eſteeme amongſt men to be his <hi>right hand, his right eye,</hi> his very Idoll. Now this is a luſt that will cauſe a man to offend. A man in this pride and ſelfe-loue to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and vphold his good opinion and eſteeme, runnes into this and that ſecret euill practiſe, and rather then his eſteeme, and credit ſhould ſinke in the world, vſes a number of ſhifts, and diſhoneſt courſes, and a companie of deceitful guiles to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his eſteeme, and runnes ſo far in at laſt, that he come not off, without fowle ſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dal. Now mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſelfe denial had preuen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted it. If ſuch a man had pluckt out this eye, cut off this hand &amp; foote, hee had not halted, nor ſtumbled
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:262:273"/> nor fallen into ſcandal. The not cutting of this foote cauſed the ſtumbler the fall. One chop had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and preuented all, for if he had but denied himſelfe, and thus thought with himſelfe, If it bee Gods will that I ſhall bee low, and meane in the world, if he will haue mee come downe and be in an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour eſtate, his will bee done, I will humbly ſubmit to his pleaſure, and I will not to vphold my credit in the world for a time hazard, and wound the credit of the Goſpell, and religion, I will tread my credit vnder foote, rather then bring any diſcredit vpon the Goſpell; If thus by ſelfe-deniall a man could haue ſubmitted to Gods wiſdome and adminiſtration, &amp; could haue mortified his ſelfe-loue, ſo as to haue laid his credit and reſpect in the world at Gods foote, how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily might a fowle ſcandal haue beene preuented? Euery vnmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:262:274"/> luſt is a ſcandal that will cauſe a man to offend, ſo many luſts ſo many tares. Therefore burne, and fire thoſe tares, <hi>gather out</hi> and <hi>caſt out</hi> thoſe ſcandals that will breed ſcandals and cauſe offences. <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 40. 41.</p>

I dare not ſay that all that fall into ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal are Hypocrites, &amp; barren. But yet ſure it is, that God many times puniſhes theſe two things with ſcandalous fals. When men are not ſo ſincere and ſo fruitfull as they ſhould bee, God leaues them to themſelues, that by ſuch ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fals they may be humbled, for not walking ſo ſincerely and ſo fruitfully as they ſhould haue done, and as their profeſſion required at their hands.

Hee had made this profeſſion before the King, and <hi>ſhould ſuch a man as hee,</hi> that had made ſuch a profeſſion doe a thing ſo contrary thereunto? What a fowle <hi>ſhame</hi> had that beene? No wonder, hauing made ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that he was <hi>aſhamed</hi> to doe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:262:276"/> it. If men would but ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what kind of perſons they are, and what kind of profeſſion they make, oh how would they for <hi>ſhame</hi> not meddle with baſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. What was the reaſon that <hi>Mordecay,</hi> would not bow to <hi>Haman? They ſpake to him daily, and hee hearkened not vnto them.</hi> And what was his reaſon. Reaſon good enough, <hi>He told them that he was a Iew.</hi> It would not ſtand with the religion hee profeſt to bow to <hi>Haman</hi> as they bowed to him. <hi>He was a Iew,</hi> one of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, that profeſſed the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the true God alone, and <hi>ſhould ſuch an one as he</hi> bow downe to <hi>Haman,</hi> not onely a mortall man but an accurſed <hi>Amalekite?</hi> Who would being as hee was, if it had beene to haue ſaued his life, haue wronged not ſo much his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as his religion, and profeſſion as to haue bowed to him. What
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:262:277"/> made <hi>Abraham</hi> that hee would not take any thing that was the King of <hi>Sodoms from a threed euen vnto a ſhooe latchet,</hi> but becauſe the King of <hi>Sodom ſhould</hi> not ſay, <hi>I haue made</hi> Abraham <hi>rich. Gen.</hi> 54. 23. Like enough <hi>Abraham</hi> had vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions, and in all places profeſſed that God whoſe name he profeſſed had made him ſo rich, therefore would hee doe nothing that might be any preiudice to that his profeſſion, hee had a care ſo to carry himſelfe that the enemies of God ſhould not haue any thing to <hi>ſay that</hi> might diſgrace his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Thus if a man would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the highneſſe of his calling, the honour of his profeſſion, and would in all tentations vnto fowle and ſhamfull actions but thinke, ſhould ſuch a man as I doe this? or who being as I am, would doe this? how might hee bee preſerned from many a foule ſcandal? <hi>Mordecay</hi>
                        <pb n="231" facs="tcp:262:277"/> told them he was a <hi>Iew,</hi> doe thou in all tentations to foule actions, tell Sathan thou art a Chriſtian, and ſhould ſuch a man as thou doe ſo?</p>

Such humble feare and trembling wil awaken to an anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable caution, and ſo may prooue a good preſeruatiue againſt the danger of Scandals.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing, this point of Gods ſeueritie may teach, is to ſtir vs vp to mourne and grieue when Scandals fall out. There be diuers
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:262:279"/> grounds of mourning in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                     <p>As firſt in regard of the <hi>woe</hi> that is to the world from offences, and the great miſchiefe that will bee done by them, That ſo many will ſtart at and flie from Religion, that ſo many will blaſpheme the Name of God, that ſo many will bee har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened to their owne ruine, here is cauſe enough of mourning to all good hearts. There is a compaſſion and there be bowels to bee ſhowne to mankinde, euen to reprobate ones, and a ſorrow ſhould there be for the loſſe of their bloud. And ſecondly, a ſorrow ſhould there be for Gods diſhonour, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches reproach. But thirdly, there is yet another ground of ſorrow ariſing from this point, a ſorrow there ſhould bee in ſuch euents in regard of the <hi>woe</hi> that wil fall vpon ſuch by whom the offence comes. If their caſe bee ſuch that ſo many
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:262:279"/> woes will perſue them, then how ſhould mens bowels earne with compaſſion towards them, and out of Chriſtian pitie commiſerate their condition? The courſe of the world is to reioyce, and inſult ouer ſuch.</p>
                     <p>That is not lawfull in ſinleſſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Prou.</hi> 24. 17. <hi>Reioyce not when thine enemy fals,</hi> namely, into ſome outward affliction, <hi>neither let thine heart bee glad when hee ſtumbles;</hi> Therefore much more vnlawfull in caſes of ſin, and ſcandal. This high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſes God. Others it may be reioyce not, are not glad, but in the meane time they mourne not, neither are they in ſorrow for Gods diſhonour, or the offenders danger. Surely, as there is ioy in Heauen when one ſinner repents, and riſes, ſo ſhould there be ſorrow on earth, when one man profeſſing Chriſt, ſinnes, and fals fowle. This was the <hi>Corinthians</hi> fault, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:262:280"/> 2. <hi>And you are puffed vp and haue not rather mourned.</hi> They ſhould therefore in that caſe haue mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſorrowed as for Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, ſo for the danger into which that man by his ſcandal had brought himſelfe. And this being done might be a great helpe to ſtir vp a man falne into a ſcandalous ſin to mourne for himſelfe. For when hee ſhall ſee others lay his caſe to heart, and to be ſo ſenſible of his ill condition, how may it ſtirre vp himſelfe to take his condition to heart much more. It is ſaid that <hi>Samuel</hi> mourned for <hi>Saul,</hi> now when <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould heare that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> mourned for him, if there had bin any grace in his heart it could not but haue made him mourne for himſelfe. It muſt needs haue thus wrought vpon him. Doth <hi>Samuel</hi> mourne for mee, and lies my caſe heauie at his heart? Alas then what cauſe haue I to mourne for my
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:262:280"/> ſelfe. It is I that haue ſinned, and it is I that muſt ſmart. What is it to <hi>Samuel,</hi> that I muſt vndergoe ſuch woe, if therefore hee, how much more ſhould I mourne. Thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſorrow might prouoke ſuch to mourne.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Laſtly, this ſeueritie of Gods Iuſtice conſidered, it ſerues for the terrour, and the humbling of ſuch by whom offences come.</p>
                     <p>Here is that which may breake the hearts of them, and make them melt into godly ſorrow. <hi>Woe vnto him by whom an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence comes.</hi> Is an offence come by thee, and art thou falne into a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal? behold here a woe out of Chriſts mouth purſuing thee, and readie to arreſt thee. Behold a woe poſting after thee to blaſt thee in thy Name, to brand thee with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie and Reproach. A woe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing thee to caſt thee out of the hearts, and ſocietie of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:262:281"/> A woe following thee to ſmite thee with pouertie and ſickneſſe, A woe to ſmite thy Family, thy Children. And ſhall not ſuch a wo terrifie, and mightily humble thine heart? How ſhould the dread of ſuch a woe hanging ouer thine head lay thee in the duſt? If a man had no care of his owne ſoule, or no care of his credit, or no care of ſocietie with the faithfull, yet if a man had but any bowels of nature towards his poore children, here is that which may make his bowels earne and roule within him. Alas what haue I done? I haue brought a woe vpon my ſelfe, and children. Ah, ſayes <hi>Dauid, Theſe ſheepe what haue the done?</hi> So mayeſt thou, Alas, theſe poore babes, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Lambes what haue they done? An heauie woe may ouertake and ſmite them for my folly. Woe is me, the cauſe that my ſoule hath to bee humbled, Oh the cauſe that I
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:262:281"/> haue to put my mouth in the duſt? Here is that which ſhould make a man hang downe his head with ſorrow to thinke of that <hi>woe,</hi> that is purſuing him at the heeles. If a man had a Bayliffe or a Sergeant alwayes watching, and dogging of him at the heeles, that he could not ſtirre out of his doores, but hee would be ready to haue him by the backe, in what a deale of feare would a man bee in ſuch a caſe? What a deale of care would hee take to make his peace, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with his Creditours? Now when a man is fallen into a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, preſently a <hi>woe</hi> is ſent out to purſue and attach ſuch a ſinner, oh then the feare, the depth of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and ſorrow, that the dread of this woe ſhould worke in ſuch a man? It ſhould make him doe as in that caſe, <hi>Prou.</hi> 6. 3, 4. <hi>Goe humble thy ſelfe, Giue not ſleepe to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids,</hi>
